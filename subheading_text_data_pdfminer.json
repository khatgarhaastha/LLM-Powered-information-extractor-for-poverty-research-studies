We  conducted  a  randomized \nevaluation  with  a  bank  in  the  Dominican  Republic  to  compare  the \nimpact  of  two  distinct  programs:  standard  accounting  training \nversus a simplified, rule-of-thumb training that taught basic financial \nheuristics.  The  rule-of-thumb \nimproved \nfirms\u2019  financial  practices,  objective  reporting  quality,  and  revenues. \nFor  micro-entrepreneurs  with  lower  skills  or  poor  initial  financial \npractices,  the  impact  of  the  rule-of-thumb  training  was  significantly \nlarger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that \nsimplifying  training  programs  might  improve  their  effectiveness  for \nless  sophisticated  individuals. \nJEL  D4,  G21,  J24,  L25,  L26,  M41, \n(\nO16\n\ntraining  significantly \n\n)\n\nIndividuals  and  micro-entrepreneurs  alike  are  asked  to  make  complex  financial \n\ndecisions in many areas of life, whether in their personal finances in the form of \nsavings decisions and retirement planning or in a business context as small business \nowners or investors. However, a growing literature shows that a large fraction of the \npopulation is woefully underprepared to make these decisions.

The evidence so far has been mixed, with large \nheterogeneity in the estimated success of training programs. For example, Bernheim \nand  Garrett \n  provide  survey  evidence  that  people  who \nattend financial counseling programs subsequently make better financial decisions, \nespecially  those  attendees  with  low  income  and  education  levels.  The  estimated \neffects of the programs are large; however, self-selection into training could lead to \nan upward bias. In contrast, Duflo and Saez \n conduct a randomized evaluation \n(\nexposing  employees  to  a  benefits  fair  that  raises  awareness  about  retirement  sav-\nings, but they find only a small effect on savings plan enrollment. Similarly, Cole, \nSampson, and Zia \n find only modest effects from a financial literacy training \nprogram in Indonesia.\n\n2003\n\n2011\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nOne major challenge in studying the impact of such financial literacy programs is \nthat measured impacts conflate the usefulness of the financial skills with the effec-\ntiveness  of  the  specific  training  methodology  used  in  the  study. To  date  we  have \nonly  very  limited  systematic  knowledge  about  the  dimensions  that  determine  the \nimpact of a financial literacy program. This impact might be crucially affected by \nthe comprehensiveness and complexity of the materials, and all training programs \nface a trade-off between the ease with which participants can grasp the concepts and \ntheir potential depth of understanding.\n\n)\n\n2007a\n\nTo advance our knowledge of how differences in the structure and complexity of \ntraining programs affect participants\u2019 performance, we worked with a bank in the \nDominican Republic to conduct a randomized evaluation comparing the impact of \ntwo financial literacy training programs for small business owners. While we do not \nfocus specifically on consumer financial literacy of the sort studied by Lusardi and \nMitchell \n and others, we note that for microenterprises the boundary between \n(\nbusiness  and  personal  financial  decisions  is  often  blurred.  In  order  to  understand \nthe channel through which financial training may affect recipients, we worked with \nADOPEM, a microfinance institution in the Dominican Republic with a long history \nof offering training to its clients, to develop two distinct types of training that span \nthe spectrum between comprehensiveness of the material and ease of understand-\ning. Our aim in designing and evaluating these two programs is to assess whether \nthere may be advantages to reducing the complexity of training programs and, in \nparticular, if the simpler rule-of-thumb training is a better fit for less-educated or \nless financially sophisticated clients.\n\nThe standard accounting program closely follows a standard approach to small \nbusiness  training,  which  is  designed  to  teach  micro-entrepreneurs  the  basics  of \ndouble-entry accounting, working capital management, and investment decisions. \nSimilar programs are used around the world by groups such as Freedom from Hunger, \nthe International Labor Organization, BRAC, and many others.1 The rule-of-thumb \ntraining focuses on very simple heuristics or routines for financial decision  making \n\n1 The traditional accounting training was based on the then-current curricula of Freedom from Hunger and the \nILO\u2019s Start and Improve Your Business program. Working with the training center at ADOPEM, we adapted these \nprograms to the Dominican context in terms of language, idiom, and the specific examples used in teaching.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n3\n\nwithout aiming to provide comprehensive accounting knowledge. For example, the \nstandard accounting trainings taught participants to separate their business and per-\nsonal  accounts  by  instructing  them  how  to  calculate  business  profits  based  on  a \ntypical accounting curriculum for micro-entrepreneurs. The rule-of-thumb training \ngave them a physical rule to keep their money in two separate drawers \n)\nand  to  only  transfer  money  from  one  drawer  to  the  other  with  an  explicit  \u201cIOU\u201d \nnote between the business and the household. At the end of the month they could \nthen count how much money was in the business drawer and know what their profits \nwere.\n\nor purses\n(\n\nBetween November 2006 and July 2008, we implemented a randomized evalu-\nation of these two training programs in collaboration with ADOPEM. We selected \n1,193 of their existing clients who had expressed some interest in training and ran-\ndomly  assigned  them  either  to  one  of  the  two  trainings  or  a  control  group.  Our \nresults document important differences in the impact of the two approaches. People \nwho were offered rule-of-thumb-based training showed significant improvements in \nthe way they managed their finances and in the accuracy and internal consistency \nof the numbers they reported. They were more likely to keep accounting records, \ncalculate monthly revenues, and separate their books for the business and the home. \nImprovements along these dimensions are on the order of 10 percentage points. In \ncontrast, we did not find any significant changes for those in the standard accounting \ntraining. We note that while only the rule-of-thumb training generated significant \nimprovements in business practices and reporting quality, the differences between \nthe two treatments in the full sample were not statistically significant. However, for \nthe subset of clients that are lower skilled or had poorer financial practices in the \nbaseline, we show that the rule-of-thumb training had a larger and significantly more \npositive impact than the standard accounting training. Overall, it appears that the \nmicro-entrepreneurs in our study were more likely to implement what they learned \nin the rule-of-thumb training.\n\nIn  studying  training  programs,  measurement  effects  are  a  natural  concern. \nRespondents  may  report  what  they  believe  surveyors  want  to  hear.  Therefore, \nwe  developed  and  looked  for  changes  in  objective  measures  of  reporting  quality. \nConsistent  with  the  belief  that  SMEs  lack  financial  controls,  the  quality  of  self-\nreported  firm  data  is  poor.  In  the  baseline  survey,  nearly  half  of  the  respondents \nmake at least one error when asked to report sales and profits over different time \nhorizons and levels of aggregation. Similarly, self-reported profits are, on average, \nsubstantially lower than what one would calculate from respondents\u2019 own revenue \nand expense detail.2 The standard accounting training generates small and not statis-\ntically significant improvements in both dimensions. In contrast, the rule-of-thumb \ntraining  significantly  improves  objective  reporting  quality. The  error  rate  falls  by \n9 percentage points, and the mean difference between the two profit measures drops \n\n)\n\n2 The direction of this reporting bias goes in the opposite direction from what De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff \n found in their sample of small firms in Sri Lanka, for which self-reported profits are larger than those calcu-\n2009\n(\nlated from revenue and expense detail. We speculate that the firms in our sample have less incentive to underreport \nrevenues but have poor recall over expense detail and fail to record the necessary information. Note also that there \nis substantial variation in these errors. In the control group, directly reported profits are less than calculated profits \nfor 58 percent of the sample and larger for 28 percent.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f4 \n\nAmericAn economic JournAl: Applied economics \n\nApril 2014\n\nby more than 50 percent. These improvements in objective reporting quality suggest \nthat the rule-of-thumb training changes actual business management practices. They \nalso underscore a key challenge in using profits as an outcome measure in business \ntraining studies. Not only are profits difficult to measure\u2014this is well understood\u2014\nbut estimated effects often conflate the effect of the treatment on actual profits with \nchanges in reporting quality.\n\nWhen looking at the impact of training on business outcomes, we again find a \nmore significant change in the group that received the rule-of-thumb training. We \nfind a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact of 0.11 standard \ndeviations on an index of revenue measures. The most significant effect is observed \nin the level of sales during self-reported bad weeks. While these results should be \ninterpreted with caution\u2014the training may have affected revenue reporting as well \nas actual revenues\u2014we note that this is consistent with an emerging pattern in other \n. \nrecent studies \n)\nThe  standard  accounting  training  produces  no  significant  effects. The  differences \nbetween the two trainings is large and statistically significant.\n\nKarlan and Valdivia 2011; Berge, Bjorvatn, and Tungodden 2012\n\n(\n\nIn  a  second  step,  we  test  for  heterogeneous  treatment  effects,  comparing  the \nrelative  effect  of  the  trainings  across  clients  with  different  characteristics.  The \n rule-of-thumb  training  produces  a  more  pronounced  effect  for  less  sophisticated \nclients: those with the lowest human capital, limited ex ante interest in accounting \nor financial training, or with baseline business practices in the lowest quartile.3 For \nthese  clients,  the  differences  between  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting \ntrainings are economically and statistically significant. These findings highlight the \nimportance of heterogeneity and targeting training materials to client characteris-\ntics. A simplified rule-of-thumb training appears well suited to the needs of the less \nsophisticated clients.4\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that effective training may operate by help-\ning  individuals  to  better  manage  negative  shocks  or  by  improving  their  financial \ncontrols, which may allow them to predict and counteract the effect of slow weeks \nmore proactively. However, it is important to note that improvements for firms in the \nrule-of-thumb treatment could stem from net business growth or from a redistribu-\ntion from other enterprises in their area. Our study design allows us to test for these \nnegative spillovers. We find a small but statistically significant drop in sales for firms \nlocated near more treated firms if these treated firms are in the same general line of \nbusiness. These results are suggestive that some of the growth in the treated firms \n\n3 The original sample frame of 1,193 individuals comprised borrowers who expressed interest in generic busi-\nness training before the start of the program. In the baseline survey, respondents were asked to indicate their interest \nin specific forms of training. We classify an individual as \u201cinterested in training\u201d if she indicated a desire to receive \ntraining in business accounting or financial management.\n\n4 Simplicity could benefit trainees in two ways, either by making concepts more accessible or by allowing more \ntime for repetition of each topic. This difference is conceptually important; however with a fixed time budget, the \ntwo are jointly determined. To disentangle these mechanisms, we aimed to keep the teaching time of each topic \nsimilar across the two training programs. The rule-of-thumb training was implemented in a total of five training \nsessions versus six for the standard accounting program. Furthermore, we implemented an additional treatment arm \nthat provided focused, hands-on repetition of all the concepts to a subset of both primary treatment groups. The \nresults, reported in Appendix Table A4, show no significant improvements from relaxing the time constraint. This \nsuggests that in this context simplicity per se and not repetition is driving the results.",

ADOPEM  was  founded  in  1982  as  a  nongovernmental \norganization  providing  a  range  of  programs  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  levels  in \nthe Dominican Republic. Since then, they have increased their focus on financial \nservices and related activities, incorporating as a bank in 2004.

In  2006,  90  percent  of  loans \nwere for amounts between RD$2,500 and RD$50,000 \n.

The  standard  accounting  treatment \noffered a traditional, principles-based course in basic accounting techniques.

In devel-\noping countries, where the tax and legal motivations for account separation often \nare weaker, it continues to receive a great deal of attention. The proposed benefits \nof account separation are twofold. On the one hand, it is seen as a very crude but \neasy way to monitor whether the business is self-sustainable and provides an esti-\nmate of the profitability of the business. The second rationale is more behavioral: \nkeeping accounts separate serves as a commitment device for the business owner \n not to overconsume and deplete the working capital in the business. In \nor relatives\n(\naddition to presenting several strategies for physically separating business and per-\nsonal funds, the rule-of-thumb treatment taught how to estimate business profits by \nsimple changes in business cash on hand, paying oneself a fixed salary, distinguish-\ning  business  and  personal  expenses,  and  easy-to-implement  tools  for  reconciling \naccounts when business funds have been used for personal expenses or the reverse. \nIn both treatments, clients received record-keeping books, handouts, and homework \nassignments to reinforce ideas or techniques from the meetings. Both classes were \noffered once a week for three hours at a time. The standard accounting treatment \nlasted for six weeks and the rule-of-thumb treatment for five. The first three classes \nof both treatments covered consumption, savings, and debt management. The final \nthree classes of the standard accounting treatment comprised basic cash account-\ning, distinguishing business and personal expenses, calculating profits, and working \ncapital management. Classes four and five of the rule-of-thumb treatment focused \non separating business and personal money and estimation techniques for calculat-\ning profits.11 Attendance for classes one through five did not differ across the two \ntreatments.\n\nThe  sample  consisted  of  1,193  existing  ADOPEM  business  or  personal  loan \n clients from Santo Domingo.12 Of these, we assigned 402 to the accounting treat-\nment, 404 to the rule-of-thumb treatment, and 387 to a control group that received \nno additional training services.

We  conducted  a  randomized \nevaluation  with  a  bank  in  the  Dominican  Republic  to  compare  the \nimpact  of  two  distinct  programs:  standard  accounting  training \nversus a simplified, rule-of-thumb training that taught basic financial \nheuristics.  The  rule-of-thumb \nimproved \nfirms\u2019  financial  practices,  objective  reporting  quality,  and  revenues. \nFor  micro-entrepreneurs  with  lower  skills  or  poor  initial  financial \npractices,  the  impact  of  the  rule-of-thumb  training  was  significantly \nlarger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that \nsimplifying  training  programs  might  improve  their  effectiveness  for \nless  sophisticated  individuals. \nJEL  D4,  G21,  J24,  L25,  L26,  M41, \n(\nO16\n\ntraining  significantly \n\n)\n\nIndividuals  and  micro-entrepreneurs  alike  are  asked  to  make  complex  financial \n\ndecisions in many areas of life, whether in their personal finances in the form of \nsavings decisions and retirement planning or in a business context as small business \nowners or investors.

The evidence so far has been mixed, with large \nheterogeneity in the estimated success of training programs. For example, Bernheim \nand  Garrett \n  provide  survey  evidence  that  people  who \nattend financial counseling programs subsequently make better financial decisions, \nespecially  those  attendees  with  low  income  and  education  levels.  The  estimated \neffects of the programs are large; however, self-selection into training could lead to \nan upward bias. In contrast, Duflo and Saez \n conduct a randomized evaluation \n(\nexposing  employees  to  a  benefits  fair  that  raises  awareness  about  retirement  sav-\nings, but they find only a small effect on savings plan enrollment. Similarly, Cole, \nSampson, and Zia \n find only modest effects from a financial literacy training \nprogram in Indonesia.\n\n2003\n\n2011\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\nOne major challenge in studying the impact of such financial literacy programs is \nthat measured impacts conflate the usefulness of the financial skills with the effec-\ntiveness  of  the  specific  training  methodology  used  in  the  study. To  date  we  have \nonly  very  limited  systematic  knowledge  about  the  dimensions  that  determine  the \nimpact of a financial literacy program. This impact might be crucially affected by \nthe comprehensiveness and complexity of the materials, and all training programs \nface a trade-off between the ease with which participants can grasp the concepts and \ntheir potential depth of understanding.\n\n)\n\n2007a\n\nTo advance our knowledge of how differences in the structure and complexity of \ntraining programs affect participants\u2019 performance, we worked with a bank in the \nDominican Republic to conduct a randomized evaluation comparing the impact of \ntwo financial literacy training programs for small business owners. While we do not \nfocus specifically on consumer financial literacy of the sort studied by Lusardi and \nMitchell \n and others, we note that for microenterprises the boundary between \n(\nbusiness  and  personal  financial  decisions  is  often  blurred.  In  order  to  understand \nthe channel through which financial training may affect recipients, we worked with \nADOPEM, a microfinance institution in the Dominican Republic with a long history \nof offering training to its clients, to develop two distinct types of training that span \nthe spectrum between comprehensiveness of the material and ease of understand-\ning. Our aim in designing and evaluating these two programs is to assess whether \nthere may be advantages to reducing the complexity of training programs and, in \nparticular, if the simpler rule-of-thumb training is a better fit for less-educated or \nless financially sophisticated clients.\n\nThe standard accounting program closely follows a standard approach to small \nbusiness  training,  which  is  designed  to  teach  micro-entrepreneurs  the  basics  of \ndouble-entry accounting, working capital management, and investment decisions. \nSimilar programs are used around the world by groups such as Freedom from Hunger, \nthe International Labor Organization, BRAC, and many others.1 The rule-of-thumb \ntraining focuses on very simple heuristics or routines for financial decision  making \n\n1 The traditional accounting training was based on the then-current curricula of Freedom from Hunger and the \nILO\u2019s Start and Improve Your Business program. Working with the training center at ADOPEM, we adapted these \nprograms to the Dominican context in terms of language, idiom, and the specific examples used in teaching.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n3\n\nwithout aiming to provide comprehensive accounting knowledge. For example, the \nstandard accounting trainings taught participants to separate their business and per-\nsonal  accounts  by  instructing  them  how  to  calculate  business  profits  based  on  a \ntypical accounting curriculum for micro-entrepreneurs. The rule-of-thumb training \ngave them a physical rule to keep their money in two separate drawers \n)\nand  to  only  transfer  money  from  one  drawer  to  the  other  with  an  explicit  \u201cIOU\u201d \nnote between the business and the household. At the end of the month they could \nthen count how much money was in the business drawer and know what their profits \nwere.\n\nor purses\n(\n\nBetween November 2006 and July 2008, we implemented a randomized evalu-\nation of these two training programs in collaboration with ADOPEM. We selected \n1,193 of their existing clients who had expressed some interest in training and ran-\ndomly  assigned  them  either  to  one  of  the  two  trainings  or  a  control  group.  Our \nresults document important differences in the impact of the two approaches. People \nwho were offered rule-of-thumb-based training showed significant improvements in \nthe way they managed their finances and in the accuracy and internal consistency \nof the numbers they reported. They were more likely to keep accounting records, \ncalculate monthly revenues, and separate their books for the business and the home. \nImprovements along these dimensions are on the order of 10 percentage points. In \ncontrast, we did not find any significant changes for those in the standard accounting \ntraining. We note that while only the rule-of-thumb training generated significant \nimprovements in business practices and reporting quality, the differences between \nthe two treatments in the full sample were not statistically significant. However, for \nthe subset of clients that are lower skilled or had poorer financial practices in the \nbaseline, we show that the rule-of-thumb training had a larger and significantly more \npositive impact than the standard accounting training. Overall, it appears that the \nmicro-entrepreneurs in our study were more likely to implement what they learned \nin the rule-of-thumb training.\n\nIn  studying  training  programs,  measurement  effects  are  a  natural  concern. \nRespondents  may  report  what  they  believe  surveyors  want  to  hear.  Therefore, \nwe  developed  and  looked  for  changes  in  objective  measures  of  reporting  quality. \nConsistent  with  the  belief  that  SMEs  lack  financial  controls,  the  quality  of  self-\nreported  firm  data  is  poor.  In  the  baseline  survey,  nearly  half  of  the  respondents \nmake at least one error when asked to report sales and profits over different time \nhorizons and levels of aggregation. Similarly, self-reported profits are, on average, \nsubstantially lower than what one would calculate from respondents\u2019 own revenue \nand expense detail.2 The standard accounting training generates small and not statis-\ntically significant improvements in both dimensions. In contrast, the rule-of-thumb \ntraining  significantly  improves  objective  reporting  quality. The  error  rate  falls  by \n9 percentage points, and the mean difference between the two profit measures drops \n\n)\n\n2 The direction of this reporting bias goes in the opposite direction from what De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff \n found in their sample of small firms in Sri Lanka, for which self-reported profits are larger than those calcu-\n2009\n(\nlated from revenue and expense detail. We speculate that the firms in our sample have less incentive to underreport \nrevenues but have poor recall over expense detail and fail to record the necessary information. Note also that there \nis substantial variation in these errors. In the control group, directly reported profits are less than calculated profits \nfor 58 percent of the sample and larger for 28 percent.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f4 \n\nAmericAn economic JournAl: Applied economics \n\nApril 2014\n\nby more than 50 percent. These improvements in objective reporting quality suggest \nthat the rule-of-thumb training changes actual business management practices. They \nalso underscore a key challenge in using profits as an outcome measure in business \ntraining studies. Not only are profits difficult to measure\u2014this is well understood\u2014\nbut estimated effects often conflate the effect of the treatment on actual profits with \nchanges in reporting quality.\n\nWhen looking at the impact of training on business outcomes, we again find a \nmore significant change in the group that received the rule-of-thumb training. We \nfind a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact of 0.11 standard \ndeviations on an index of revenue measures. The most significant effect is observed \nin the level of sales during self-reported bad weeks. While these results should be \ninterpreted with caution\u2014the training may have affected revenue reporting as well \nas actual revenues\u2014we note that this is consistent with an emerging pattern in other \n. \nrecent studies \n)\nThe  standard  accounting  training  produces  no  significant  effects. The  differences \nbetween the two trainings is large and statistically significant.\n\nKarlan and Valdivia 2011; Berge, Bjorvatn, and Tungodden 2012\n\n(\n\nIn  a  second  step,  we  test  for  heterogeneous  treatment  effects,  comparing  the \nrelative  effect  of  the  trainings  across  clients  with  different  characteristics.  The \n rule-of-thumb  training  produces  a  more  pronounced  effect  for  less  sophisticated \nclients: those with the lowest human capital, limited ex ante interest in accounting \nor financial training, or with baseline business practices in the lowest quartile.3 For \nthese  clients,  the  differences  between  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting \ntrainings are economically and statistically significant. These findings highlight the \nimportance of heterogeneity and targeting training materials to client characteris-\ntics. A simplified rule-of-thumb training appears well suited to the needs of the less \nsophisticated clients.4\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that effective training may operate by help-\ning  individuals  to  better  manage  negative  shocks  or  by  improving  their  financial \ncontrols, which may allow them to predict and counteract the effect of slow weeks \nmore proactively. However, it is important to note that improvements for firms in the \nrule-of-thumb treatment could stem from net business growth or from a redistribu-\ntion from other enterprises in their area. Our study design allows us to test for these \nnegative spillovers. We find a small but statistically significant drop in sales for firms \nlocated near more treated firms if these treated firms are in the same general line of \nbusiness. These results are suggestive that some of the growth in the treated firms \n\n3 The original sample frame of 1,193 individuals comprised borrowers who expressed interest in generic busi-\nness training before the start of the program. In the baseline survey, respondents were asked to indicate their interest \nin specific forms of training. We classify an individual as \u201cinterested in training\u201d if she indicated a desire to receive \ntraining in business accounting or financial management.\n\n4 Simplicity could benefit trainees in two ways, either by making concepts more accessible or by allowing more \ntime for repetition of each topic. This difference is conceptually important; however with a fixed time budget, the \ntwo are jointly determined. To disentangle these mechanisms, we aimed to keep the teaching time of each topic \nsimilar across the two training programs. The rule-of-thumb training was implemented in a total of five training \nsessions versus six for the standard accounting program. Furthermore, we implemented an additional treatment arm \nthat provided focused, hands-on repetition of all the concepts to a subset of both primary treatment groups. The \nresults, reported in Appendix Table A4, show no significant improvements from relaxing the time constraint. This \nsuggests that in this context simplicity per se and not repetition is driving the results.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n5\n\nwas due to crowding out of other firms and identify an important avenue for future \nwork.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Should any mem-\nber fail to repay, each member suffers the default consequences as if she herself failed to repay.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f8 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nand capacitator training program for the standard accounting treatment were based \non the financial education program designed by Freedom from Hunger, a US-based \nnonprofit organization, together with the Citigroup Foundation and adapted to local \nconditions.10\n\n)\n\nThe rule-of-thumb treatment taught participants simple rules for financial deci-\nsion  making,  focusing  on  the  need  to  separate  business  and  personal  accounts. \nAccount separation is a staple rule in developed country entrepreneurship. In devel-\noping countries, where the tax and legal motivations for account separation often \nare weaker, it continues to receive a great deal of attention. The proposed benefits \nof account separation are twofold. On the one hand, it is seen as a very crude but \neasy way to monitor whether the business is self-sustainable and provides an esti-\nmate of the profitability of the business. The second rationale is more behavioral: \nkeeping accounts separate serves as a commitment device for the business owner \n not to overconsume and deplete the working capital in the business. In \nor relatives\n(\naddition to presenting several strategies for physically separating business and per-\nsonal funds, the rule-of-thumb treatment taught how to estimate business profits by \nsimple changes in business cash on hand, paying oneself a fixed salary, distinguish-\ning  business  and  personal  expenses,  and  easy-to-implement  tools  for  reconciling \naccounts when business funds have been used for personal expenses or the reverse. \nIn both treatments, clients received record-keeping books, handouts, and homework \nassignments to reinforce ideas or techniques from the meetings. Both classes were \noffered once a week for three hours at a time. The standard accounting treatment \nlasted for six weeks and the rule-of-thumb treatment for five. The first three classes \nof both treatments covered consumption, savings, and debt management. The final \nthree classes of the standard accounting treatment comprised basic cash account-\ning, distinguishing business and personal expenses, calculating profits, and working \ncapital management. Classes four and five of the rule-of-thumb treatment focused \non separating business and personal money and estimation techniques for calculat-\ning profits.11 Attendance for classes one through five did not differ across the two \ntreatments.\n\nThe  sample  consisted  of  1,193  existing  ADOPEM  business  or  personal  loan \n clients from Santo Domingo.12 Of these, we assigned 402 to the accounting treat-\nment, 404 to the rule-of-thumb treatment, and 387 to a control group that received \nno additional training services. The treatment was assigned at the individual level \nand administrative data was used to stratify according to loan size, years of borrow-\ning, and whether or not a client maintained a formal savings account with the bank. \nBaseline survey data was not available at the time of the stratification. ADOPEM \n\n10 The ADOPEM training program is most closely related to the budgeting module of the FFH training program. \nThis module includes training on: how to develop a financial plan for the household expenses, how to adapt the \nspending to a restricted income, how to develop a budget for the house and the business, how to prioritize spending, \nhow to record income and expenses, how to use income and expenses bookkeeping to make financial decisions, and \nhow to store financial documents. Importantly, both ADOPEM training programs focused on maintaining a clear \nseparation of business accounts.\n\n11 See Table A1 for a more detailed summary of the materials covered.\n12 At the request of ADOPEM, group loan clients with loans smaller than RD$15,000 were excluded from the \nstudy. The original sample comprised 1,200 individuals; however, 7 observations were discarded due to errors in \nthe baseline survey.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n9\n\nmade no additional policy changes concurrent with the training program. The treat-\nment was conducted in two waves. The first wave, comprising 302 treatment assign-\nments, was conducted from March to May 2007, and the second wave, comprising \nthe remainder, ran from July to August of the same year.13\n\nAll courses were taught by qualified local instructors. The majority had university \ndegrees and experience with adult education, in most cases with ADOPEM directly. \nCourses were offered at seven schools throughout Santo Domingo and scheduled \nbased on preferences elicited during the baseline survey. In addition, the course was \nheavily subsidized. Fees were randomly assigned at RD$200 \n(\nor zero, relative to an overall program cost of approximately RD$700.14\n\napproximately US$6\n\n)\n\nIn  order  to  begin  understanding  the  potential  limitations  to  classroom-based, \nfinancial training, we also randomly assigned half of the people in each of the treat-\nment groups to receive follow-up training consisting of in-person visits of a financial \ntrainer to the micro-entrepreneur\u2019s business. When necessary, the trainers reviewed \nthe  class  materials  with  the  entrepreneurs,  helped  clarify  any  questions  they  had, \nand reviewed their account records, if any. The purpose of the on-site visits was to \nensure that individuals understood the material and were capable of implementing \ntheir newly-acquired financial accounting skills in their businesses. This structure \nhelps us to differentiate the channel by which training affects the participants. If we \ndo not find an effect of training we can determine whether this result is due to the \ninability of the participants to understand what was taught in class or whether the \nmaterial itself, even when properly understood, is not helpful.\n\nIII.  Data and Empirical Strategy\n\nWe constructed the original sample frame based on administrative data collected \nby ADOPEM in the ordinary course of operations. Beginning in November 2006, \nwe conducted a baseline survey of each study participant using a professional sur-\nvey firm unaffiliated with ADOPEM. We collected information on household and \nbusiness characteristics, business practices and performance, business skills, train-\ning history, and interest in future training. The endline survey was conducted during \nthe summer of 2008, at least 12 months after training was completed. We augmented \nthe surveys with administrative data from ADOPEM.\n\nA. Descriptive statistics\n\nTable  1  reports  summary  statistics  for  the  full  sample  and  each  of  the  three \nassignment  groups  from  the  baseline  data.  Given  that  the  treatments  were  ran-\ndomly assigned, we expect individuals in the three assignment groups to be similar \n\n13 A third wave of 800 individuals across all three assignment categories was planned for late 2007, but was \n\ncancelled due to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Dean and Noel and Tropical Storm Olga.\n\n14 The original design was intended to test for selection effects. As noted in Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, the \nemerging approach to business development services calls for pricing training services at or above marginal costs. \nHowever, if those entrepreneurs who would most benefit are uncertain of the program\u2019s benefits or subject to tighter \ncredit constraints, this approach may induce adverse selection. Unfortunately, due to logistical issues associated \nwith data gathering we are unable to analyze the selection results along this dimension.\n\n2011\n\n(\n\n)\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f10 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nTable 1\u2014Baseline Summary Statisticsa\n\nFull \nsample\n mean\n2\n\n(\n\n)\n\nStandard \naccounting \ntreatment\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom\ncontrol\n5\n\n(\n\n)\n\nRule-of-\nthumb \ntreatment\n6\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom \ncontrol\n7\n\n(\n\n)\n\nControl\n3\n\n(\n\n)\n\nObservations\n1\n\n(\npanel A.

As shown in the table, this expectation generally holds across our \n18  baseline  characteristics;  however,  there  are  two  marginally  significant  differ-\nences. Individuals assigned to the standard accounting treatment are marginally less \nlikely to report keeping accounting records or separating their business and personal \naccounts in the baseline. Individuals in the rule-of-thumb training also report lower \nrevenues in both average and bad weeks, although these differences fall below the \n10  percent  significance  level.15  Therefore,  we  control  for  these  characteristics  in \nthe regression analytics that follow.

While all participants had been chosen by ADOPEM as clients who \npotentially  were  interested  in  financial  training,  only  about  47  percent  explicitly \nstated interest in training when surveyed. Reported sales are RD$6,399 in an aver-\nage week and RD$3,500 in a bad week. Approximately half of the participants oper-\nate businesses engaged in retail sales and trading. We also found \nnot reported in the \n(\ntable\n that 60 percent of the businesses are sole proprietorships with no employees \nin addition to the borrower. Of the rest, 80 percent have 1 or 2 employees in addi-\ntion to the borrower and few have more than 5. Typical businesses include small \ncolmados\nretail  shops,  general  stores \n,  beauty  salons,  and  food  service,  serving \n)\ngeographically-clustered, local markets.\n\n)\n\n(\n\nThe  final  panel  of Table  1  reports  the  business  practices  of  the  small  business \nowners.

Anecdotal evidence and discussions with ADOPEM sug-\ngest an unusually high level of program dropout, business closure, and out-migration \nfrom the Dominican Republic by the sample population in response to Hurricanes \nDean and Noel and Tropical Storm Olga, which flooded large parts of the country \n\n[\n\n]\n\n/\n\n15 Average, good, and bad periods were self defined by the respondents. For good and bad periods, the questions \nwere framed as follows: \u201cNow we want to know how much your business sells when things are going well and when \nthings are not going so well. Try to give us your best estimate. Do not worry if you do not know the exact value. \nHow much do you sell in a \n\n week?\u201d\n\ngood\n\nbad\n\n16 Appendix Table A2 demonstrates a clear pattern of selection into training and highlights the need for exog-\nenous  variation  in  treatment  assignment  to  assess  the  causal  mechanisms  though  which  training  can  affect  out-\ncomes. Conditional on assignment to the treatment group, those who attend have more education. They are also \nmore likely to have expressed an interest in accounting training during the baseline survey; however, a prior interest \nin increasing savings or improving cash management is not associated with increased attendance. They also tend \nto have lower revenues but bigger plans, as measured by the share of the loan intended for fixed asset purchases. \nAttendance does not vary with individuals\u2019 business type. Interestingly, we see some evidence for the reverse of an \n\u201cAshenfelter dip\u201d: individuals reporting that their business had improved in the month preceding the baseline survey \nwere 6.4 percentage points more likely to attend the training.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f12 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nand  caused  catastrophic  damage. The  survey  team  utilized  various  forms  of  con-\ntact information from baseline and administrative data as well as credit officers in \nthe field in its efforts to locate all individuals in the study for the endline survey. \nUltimately, we collected endline data for 87 percent of participants reporting in the \nbaseline.17\n\nB. objective Reporting Measures\n\nSelf-reporting  bias  raises  concerns  about  any  measures  of  business  manage-\nment practices. Treated individuals may, for example, report maintaining separate \nbusiness and personal accounts because they were told this was important and not \nbecause they actually do so. To allay such concerns, we construct an objective index \nof financial reporting errors. We classify as an error any report of bad period sales \ngreater  than  average  or  good;  average  period  sales  better  than  good;  or  average \nperiod  profits better than good period sales for each of daily, weekly, and monthly \nreported outcomes. In the baseline, 45 percent of subjects make at least one mis-\ntake and 11 percent make three or more. Along the same lines, we compare self-\nreported profits to profits calculated from respondents\u2019 own revenue and expense \ndetail. These differences are large; self-reported profits are only 60 percent of those \ncalculated from the disaggregated components. While these differences could result \nfrom  misreporting  any  of  the  components,  we  believe  the  most  plausible  expla-\nnation  is  that  respondents  fail  to  remember  and,  hence,  underreport  their  various \ndetailed business expenses. This poses challenges when interpreting the impact of \neither treatment on profits. For example, training could increase actual profits while \nimproving recall of business expenses, leaving reported profits unchanged. For this \nreason, we are cautious when interpreting any profit measure as a stand-alone out-\ncome. To account for this possibility, we estimate the effect of each treatment on the \nraw and absolute difference between self-reported and calculated profits. Because \nwe  do  not  have  a  measure  of  true  profits,  we  cannot  make  statements  about  the \naccuracy of these measures; however, we expect that if either treatment improves \nfinancial controls, the difference between the two profit measures become smaller.\n\nC. Empirical strategy\n\nRandom assignment of the treatments allows us to obtain unbiased estimates of \nthe effect of being offered the training program by estimating the following equation:\n\n1\n\n(\n\n) \n\ny\n\nE \ny\n i \nX\n i \n  +   \u03b2 2  Ro T\n i \n  =  \u03b1  +   \u03b2 1  Acc t\n  i  \n  +  \u03b4  \n  +  \u03b3  \n\nB \n  +   \u03b5 i   ,\n  i  \n\nE   is  the  endline  value  of  the  outcome  variable  of  interest;  Acc t\n  i  \n\n i   is  an \nwhere   y\n i   is  an  indicator  for \n indicator  for  being  assigned  to  the  accounting  treatment;  Ro T\n i  is a matrix of baseline-measured \nbeing assigned to the rule-of-thumb treatment;  X\ncovariates  including  business  types,  loan  size,  and  participation  in  an ADOPEM \n\n17 Section IVD discusses attrition in more detail.\n\n \n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n13\n\n\u03b2\n\nB ,  explains \nsavings  account.

These \nspillovers  can  take  two  forms.  First,  there  may  be  positive  knowledge  spillovers. \nTrained  clients  may  actively  pass  on  newly  acquired  knowledge  to  their  peers  or \nneighboring businesses may observe and mimic improved management practices. \nSecond,  business  outcomes  for  the  treated  may  improve  either  by  expanding  the \noverall  market,  \u201cgrowing  the  pie\u201d,  or  by  a  reallocation  of  revenues  from  control \nfirms to the treated, \u201cbusiness stealing\u201d.

The  estimated  effect  on  the  business  practices  index  is  0.07, \np-value: \napproximately  0.12  standard  deviations,  but  not  statistically  significant \n( \n0.198\n. Among the component elements, only the estimated effect on setting aside \n)\nfunds for business expenses is significant at the 10 percent level or better. Estimates \nfor the other business practice outcomes, while all positive, are not statistically sig-\nnificant and generally close to zero.\n\nIn  contrast,  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  reported  in  column  4,  substantially \nincreases the likelihood that individuals adopt better financial practices. Clients in \nthat treatment group report a higher likelihood of separating business and personal \ncash, keeping accounting records, separating business and personal accounts, set-\nting aside cash for business, and calculating revenues formally. Each of these mea-\nsures  increases  by  6 to 12  percentage  points  relative  to  the  control  group,  which \ndid not receive training, and all are significant at the 5 percent level or better. The \nrule-of-thumb  treatment  also  produces  a  significant  0.14  increase  in  the  business \npractices index, approximately 0.25 standard deviations. When looking at savings \nbehavior, we find a marginally significant impact of the rule-of-thumb training on \nthe likelihood of having any savings. The increase in total reported savings, while \nlarge, is not significant. Column 5 reports the p-values for tests of the equality of the \nstandard accounting and rule-of-thumb treatment effects. When considering the full \nsample, the rule-of-thumb training has a consistently more positive effect. The dif-\nferential impact on both separating business and personal cash and keeping account-\ning  records  are  significant  at  the  10  percent  level  or  better,  but  despite  the  rather \nlarge difference we cannot reject equality for the impact on the index of business \npractices.\n\n)\n\nThe second set of results shows the impact of training on measures of objective \nreporting  quality.

Individuals in both treatment groups \nsee Section IIIB for a detailed description\n(\nare less likely to make any such mistakes. However, only for the rule-of-thumb train-\ning is the improvement significant, with treated individuals 8 percentage points less \nlikely to make any errors. Similarly, both treatments appear to reduce differences \nbetween directly reported profits and profits calculated from respondents\u2019 reported \nrevenues  and  expenses.

As  noted,  individuals \nassigned  to  the  rule-of-thumb  training  reported  lower  sales  in  these  periods  than \nthose assigned to the control group. These differences in baseline revenues are not \nsignificant at conventional levels; however, the treatment effect is insignificant when \ni.e., \nthe controls for baseline sales are dropped. Moreover, the quality of a period \ngood, average or bad\n was defined by the respondent, and our results are consistent \nwith both a change in how respondents classified periods and an improvement in \nactual revenues. With this caveat in mind, these results parallel those of Karlan and \nValdivia \n,  both  of  which  find \n)\nrevenue improvements in bad periods as a result of training. The findings remain \nconsistent with the possibility that effective training may operate by helping indi-\nviduals to better manage negative shocks or by alerting them to such shocks such \nthat they can counteract the effect of slow weeks.

Heterogeneous Treatment Effects\n\nThe  efficacy  of  different  training  programs  is  likely  to  vary  through  the  popu-\nlation.  Table  4  reports  whether  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting  train-\nings  have  heterogeneous  treatment  effects  for  different  subgroups.  We  focus  on \nthree dimensions along which we expected training may have differential effects. \nFirst, we classify an individual as high-skilled if she has completed high school or \nreceived previous formal financial training and low-skilled otherwise. Differences \nin  treatment  effects  along  this  dimension  allow  us  to  test  whether  the  effective-\nness of training depends on initial levels of human capital. Second, we classify an \nindividual as interested in training if she indicated in the baseline survey a desire to \nreceive training in business accounting or financial management and not otherwise. \nDifferences along this dimension allow us to test whether the effectiveness of train-\ning depends on a participant\u2019s motivation. Third, we compare individuals across the \nquartiles of baseline business management practices.\n\nColumns 2 and 3 compare the impact of the trainings across different levels of \ninitial  human  capital.  The  first  row  in  each  panel  focuses  on  whether  the  clients \nadopted  better  business  practices. The  impacts  of  the  rule-of-thumb  treatment  on \n business  practices  appear  independent  of  skill  level;  both  subgroups  show  large \nand significant improvements. We then look at our different measures of objective \nreporting quality. Across both skill levels, we find that the rule-of-thumb treatment, \non average, reduced the likelihood that individuals made reporting errors, although \nthe results are only significant for low-skill individuals. Finally, we also test whether \nthere is a differential impact on business outcomes. The coefficients for the impact \non the revenue measures are positive for both groups, but none of the effects is sig-\nnificant when splitting the sample by skill level.24\n\nColumns 4 and 5 repeat the heterogeneous treatment analysis along the dimension \nof interest in training. Again, we find a positive effect on both groups, with similar \nand significant magnitudes. Objective reporting quality improves for both groups, \nwith  a  larger  effect for those expressing  greater interest in training. There are  no \nsignificant differences in the business performance measures across the groups.\n\nThis stands in contrast to the results of Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, which finds \n)\nthat less interested clients benefitted more from the training. We hypothesize that this  \n\n2011\n(\n\n24 The results for employment, not reported here but available from the authors, are interesting. The rule-of-\nthumb treatment reduces the number of employees for the low-skill group but increases employment in the busi-\nnesses  of  the  high-skilled  group.

It suggests that in certain \ncircumstances the price mechanism may effectively allocate training programs.\n\nThe  last  three  columns  of  Table  4  show  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  had  a \nlarger impact on businesses with poorer management practices in the baseline.25 On \n\n25 Results for the second quartile of baseline business practices are suppressed due to space constraints.

The effects on objective reporting quality and busi-\nness performance are insufficiently precise to draw further conclusions. This might \nsuggest that the rule-of-thumb training allows the people with poor practices ex ante \nto catch up with the others. The ability of the rule-of-thumb training to benefit even \nthe most poorly managed businesses is primarily responsible for its larger average \ntreatment effect and supports the hypothesis that there may be advantages to reduc-\ning the complexity of training programs when targeting micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nThe second panel of Table 4 repeats the exact same set of regressions for the dif-\nferent subsamples for the standard accounting treatment group. There are several \npoints of note. First, the standard accounting treatment improves objective report-\ning quality, but only for high-skilled individuals. The accounting training actually \nincreases reporting errors for businesses in the lowest quartile of baseline business \npractices. Second, those who expressed greater interest in the training ex ante appear \nto change their business practices in response to the accounting training, while those \nwith  less  interest  are  unaffected. This  stands  in  contrast  to  the  pattern  of  hetero-\ngeneity  for  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  which  produced  comparable  and  in  some \ncases larger improvements for those who expressed less interest in training. Finally, \nlower-skilled clients in the accounting training report meaningful drops in their rev-\nenues. These effects are substantial, approximately 0.2 standard deviations from the \nbaseline reported values. Similarly, we find a significant reduction in sales for the \nquartile of clients with the worst business practices in the baseline.\n\nThese results are quite surprising and could be driven by several different chan-\nnels. On the one hand, there could be a negative causal effect of accounting training \non  less  educated  clients  if  they  spend  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  implement  standard \naccounting  techniques  without  much  success. Alternatively  one  could  conjecture \nthat trained clients are more realistic about their actual revenues while prior to the \ntraining they might have been overly optimistic. The relatively large effect on the \nraw difference in reported profits for this subgroup is consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that treated clients may be more aware of their true revenues but the observed \nincrease in reporting errors points in the other direction. Ultimately, we cannot rule \nout either channel.\n\nC. Differences between Rule-of-Thumb and standard Accounting Training\n\nWe  have  shown  above  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  stronger  positive \nimpact across several dimensions than the accounting training, especially on clients \nwith low education and worse business practices relative to the control group. We \nnow compare these two trainings directly to each other. The final panel of Table 4 \nreports the difference in the treatment effect between the rule-of-thumb and account-\ning trainings, and the p-values for testing the equality of treatment effects for all \nsubgroups. Looking across the subgroups, we find a very strong and consistent pat-\ntern according to individuals\u2019 interest in training \n. The rule-of-\n)\nthumb training had a substantially more positive impact than the accounting training \nfor clients that reported limited interest in training ex ante. There is a significantly \nlarger  effect  of  0.12  in  the  index  of  business  practices,  0.21  standard  deviations \n\ncolumns 4 and 5\n\n(\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n21\n\np-value: 0.055\n( \n\np-value: 0.052\n, and a 0.17 difference in the revenue index, 0.20 standard devia-\n)\n( \ntions \n. A similar pattern is observed in bad week sales, with results \nsignificant at approximately the 5 percent level. For those with a strong prior inter-\nest in training, the differences between the two trainings are not significant. On the \nwhole, the rule-of-thumb training generates substantially better outcomes for those \nwith a lower interest in training.\n\n)\n\nWhile not evident in the measures of business practices, we find similar outcomes \nalong the skill dimension in terms of objective reporting quality and business perfor-\nmance. Low-skilled individuals in the rule-of-thumb treatment were 12 percentage \npoints less likely to commit any reporting errors than those in the standard account-\n. This translates into differences in reported revenues, \ning training \np-value: \nwith a difference of 0.17 in the revenue index, 0.20 standard deviations \n( \n0.044\n\np-value: 0.016\n( \n\n)\n\nFinally, we look across quartiles of baseline business practices. In line with the \nfindings above, we see that the clients in the lowest quartile receiving the rule-of-\nthumb training see substantially larger and significant improvements in business and \nfinancial practices relative to those in the accounting training. Again, these results \ntranslate into substantially better sales outcomes. Within the middle quartiles there \nare no significant differences between the two trainings. Surprisingly, the difference \nin  business  practices  reemerges  in  the  top  quartile,  but  these  differences  are  not \nobserved in objective reporting quality or revenues.\n\n.\n)\n\nTaken  together  the  findings  suggest  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  sig-\nnificant and positive effect relative to the accounting training on clients that start \nfrom lower levels of skill, business practices, and interest in training. The same does \nnot  hold  for  higher  skilled,  better  managed  or  more  interested  businesses,  where \nthe impact of both trainings is similar. Not only is the rule-of-thumb training more \nlikely to improve business practices for clients at the lower end of the spectrum, it \nhas real effects on outcomes. This suggests that it is important to correctly match \nthe  characteristics  of  the  clients  with  the  type  of  training  that  will  be  useful  for \nthem.  Giving  an  unsophisticated  client  standard  accounting  training  can  actually \nreduce their performance, while the rule-of-thumb training substantially improves \ntheir outcomes.\n\nD. Robustness checks\n\nFirst, we discuss attrition. Our response rate was relatively high\u201487 percent of \nparticipants were reached for the endline\u2014but we find some evidence for selective \nattrition.  Treatment  group  individuals  who  were  not  reached  for  the  endline  sur-\nvey have generally higher baseline revenues \n than those who \ndropped  from  the  control  group \n.  Given  the  relatively  low \nrevenue  index \nlevel of attrition, this difference of 0.18 standard deviations is not statistically sig-\nnificant.  Nonetheless,  it  suggests  that  the  reported  results  for  business  outcomes \nmay understate the program\u2019s true effect. There are no differences across the two \ntreatment groups.\n\nrevenue index 0.05\n\n0.09\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\nIn addition to survey nonresponse, there is a relatively high incidence of business \nexit:  78  percent  of  individuals  reached  in  the  endline  report  operating  their  own \n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f22 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nbusiness relative to 97 percent in the baseline. As discussed above, qualitative evi-\ndence and discussions with ADOPEM suggest that a string of natural disasters led to \nan unusually high rate of out-migration from the Dominican Republic and business \nexit by the sample population. To test for differential attrition, we estimate a linear \nprobability model of business ownership in the endline on indicators for treatment \nstatus.  Coefficients  for  assignment  to  the  standard  accounting  and  rule-of-thumb \ntrainings are \n\n and 0.001 \nWe analyze the implications for our estimated treatment effects of different plau-\nsible assumptions for the potential outcomes of individuals who are not reached in \nthe endline or who report not having a business. We construct bounds on the treat-\nment effects for the rule-of-thumb training on the business practices index, revenue \nindex, and any reporting errors indicator using a range of assumptions for the pat-\ntern of attrition following an approach based on Horowitz and Manski \n, Lee \n2004\n2002\n\np-value: 0.235\n( \n\np-value: 0.977\n( \n\n, and Kling and Liebman \n\n0.037 \n\n2000\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTable 5 reports these results. Column 4 reproduces the unadjusted results from \nTable 2. Columns 1 and 7 report lower and upper bounds under the worst-case sce-\nnario. We compute worst-case lower bounds by imputing missing values for each \nobservation in the treatment group as the minimum value observed in that group. For \nmissing observations in the control group, we use the maximum value observed in \nthe control group. In practice, because many of the outcomes are binary, this equates \nto assuming that all missing data for the treatment groups is zero and all missing \ndata for the control is one. Worst case upper bounds are computed analogously.\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nWe also consider alternative scenarios for missing observations. Column 2 con-\nstructs a lower bound by imputing missing values for the treatment group as the mean \nfor treatment group minus 0.25 standard deviations of the observed distribution for \nthe group. Missing values for the control group are imputed as the control group \nmean plus 0.25 standard deviations. Column 3 repeats this calculation for 0.10 stan-\ndard deviations. Upper bounds calculated using the same scenarios are reported in \ncolumns 5 and 6. Given the combined magnitude of attrition and business closure, \nthe  worst  case  bounds  are  large  and  uninformative.  The  range  tightens  consider-\nably when we employ plausible assumptions for the missing data. The results for \nbusiness  practices  are  the  most  robust,  maintaining  significance  at  the  10 percent \nlevel up to nearly a 0.50 standard deviation difference between the imputed values \nfor missing treatment and control observations. The effect on reporting errors also \nmaintains statistical significance for a relatively large band of assumptions regard-\ning missing data. Results for the revenue index, which were only marginally sig-\nnificant in the unadjusted results, are the most sensitive to assumptions regarding \nmissing observations.\n\nWe  then  consider  the  effect  of  the  follow-up  training,  with  the  aim  of  under-\nstanding the mechanisms though which training improves or fails to improve out-\ncomes.26 The results, available in Appendix Table A4, are not conclusive.

We consider this weak suggestive evidence \nthat our findings may be driven by simplicity per se rather than the standard account-\ning training\u2014because it covered more material\u2014requiring longer sessions or more \ncontact with an instructor.\n\nE. spillover Effects\n\n3\n\n4\n and \n(\n\nTable 6 provides suggestive evidence that some of the improvement in revenues \ngenerated by the treatments is due in part to crowding out competing businesses. It \nreports the results from estimating equations \n. As shown in columns 1 and \n(\n2, there is no evidence of learning spillovers from the training. Conditional on the \ndensity of businesses in one\u2019s neighborhood, the proximity of additional firms that \nwere randomly assigned to either training program does not have a demonstrable \neffect on the index of own business practices.

However, when we distinguish those neighboring businesses according \nto  their  industry,  a  clearer  pattern  emerges.

The results for sales in bad weeks, reported in column 6, follow the \nsame pattern, but none of the differences are significant. Overall these results pro-\nvide suggestive evidence that at least some of the improved sales due to financial \nliteracy training in this setting are due to crowd-out of other businesses.\n\nV.  Conclusion\n\nThe results from this study suggest that training to improve knowledge of finance \nand financial accounting indeed can have a positive effect on the management prac-\ntices of small businesses in an emerging market such as the Dominican Republic. \nHowever, we show that the impact of such training crucially depends on the form in \nwhich financial literacy training is provided. In this setting, a program that relies on \nthe standard approach to small business training, teaching the fundamentals of finan-\ncial accounting, had no measurable effect. But a training program based on simple \nrules of thumb led to significant improvements in the way businesses managed their \nfinances. Businesses in the rule-of-thumb training were more likely to implement \nthe material that was taught, keep accounting records, calculate monthly revenues, \nand separate their business and personal financial records. Moreover, these results \ntranslated into improvements in objective reporting quality and revenues.\n\nBeneath these average results, there is a clear pattern of heterogeneity. The rela-\ntive gains from the rule-of-thumb training were particularly large for firms starting at \nthe lower ends of the performance, ability or interest spectrums. This highlights the \nimportance of precisely evaluating the mechanisms through which training works \nor  does  not  work.  We  do  not  suggest  that  the  value  of  simplification  is  generic. \nRather, we show that one size does not fit all when it comes to training programs. It \nis important to match the training to the targeted client base.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate how rules of thumb can be applied effec-\ntively. We  believe  that  going  forward  it  will  be  important  to  understand  in  more \ndetail the potential costs and benefits of rule-of-thumb-based learning. For example, \nwould more advanced clients do better with more sophisticated training material? \nAre  there  situations  where  rule-of-thumb-based  training  could  make  it  more  dif-\nficult  for  businesses  to  adjust  to  new  circumstances  or  make  sense  of  unforeseen \ndevelopments?\n\nThese results come with two caveats. First, business performance is ultimately \nmeasured by profits not revenue. Not only are small business profits difficult to mea-\nsure, but as we demonstrate, training can affect reporting quality as well as actual \nprofits. Significant methodological improvements are necessary to generate reliable \nmeasures for this important outcome. Second, we find suggestive evidence that at \nleast some of the observed revenue increases come from crowding out sales by other \nfirms in the vicinity. More research is required before we can make conclusive state-\nments about the welfare effects of business training programs. Nevertheless, based \non these findings, it appears that in at least some contexts significant gains could be \nmade from simplifying training programs and relying more on easy-to-implement, \npractical rules of thumb.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f26 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nAppendix: Description of Training Programs\n\nTable A1\u2014 Summary of Training Programs\n\nClass 1\n\nClass 2\n\nClass 3\n\nClass 4\n\nClass 5\n\nRule of thumb\n\nSavings \n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002we\u2002should\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Set\u2002saving\u2002goals\n\u2022\u2002 Save\u2002for\u2002emergencies\n\u2022\u2002 Decide\u2002how\u2002to\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Compare\u2002saving\u2002services\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002savings\n\nConsumption\n\u2022\u2002 Financial\u2002burden\n\u2022\u2002 Study\u2002your\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002income\u2002&\u2002expenses\n\nDebt management\n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002borrowing\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002much\u2002debt\u2002I\u2002can\u2002afford\n\u2022\u2002 Default,\u2002what\u2002is\u2002it\u2002and\u2002how\u2002it\u2002happens\n\u2022\u2002 Cost\u2002of\u2002default\u2002and\u2002excessive\u2002debt\n\nAccount separation\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Why\u2002separate\u2002money\u2002for\u2002the\u2002household\u2002\n\nfrom money for the business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Separating\u2002household\u2002and\u2002business\u2002money\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Setting\u2002ourselves\u2002a\u2002salary\u2002\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002recognize\u2002and\u2002keep\u2002records\u2002of\u2002\nflows between business and household\n\nEstimation methods\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002total\u2002monthly\u2002flow\u2002of\u2002money\u2002\n\nbetween household and business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002increase/decrease\u2002of\u2002money\u2002in\u2002\nthe business between beginning and end \nof the month\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\n\nClass 6\n\nNone\n\nAccounting\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nBasic Accounting 1\n\u2022\u2002 Relevance\u2002of\u2002accounting\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002to\u2002record\u2002expenses\u2002and\u2002revenues\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002estimate\u2002and\u2002record\u2002daily\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\u2002using\u2002revenue\u2002and\u2002expense\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Understanding\u2002the\u2002difference\u2002between\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation and profits\n\nBasic Accounting 2\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Recording\u2002personal\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\u2002in\u2002\n\nbusiness accounts\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002nonoperational\u2002(personal)\u2002cash\u2002\n\noutflows and inflows.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Incorporating\u2002personal\u2002cashflows\u2002into\u2002profit\u2002\n\nestimation.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002include\u2002fixed\u2002costs\u2002into\u2002the\u2002profit\u2002\n\ncalculations\n\nBasic Accounting 3\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Aggregating\u2002daily\u2002records\u2002into\u2002monthly\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 Calculating\u2002monthly\u2002profit\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002payable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002receivable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n27\n\nTable A2\u2014Determinants of Attendance Conditional on Assignment to Treatment\n\nDependent variable\n\nFemale\n\nNumber of children\n\nHigh skillb\n\nAny savings\n\nInterested in accounting and financial training\n\nCurrent loan \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nLoan planned for fixed assets \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nRevenue indexc\n\nBusiness practices indexc\n\nBuy-sell businessd\n\nReports business improving\n\nConstant\n\nAttend any classa\n1\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.081\n0.063\n0.035***\n0.011\n0.104***\n0.040\n)\n0.011\n0.039\n0.074**\n0.036\n0.003\n0.011\n0.023**\n0.010\n)\n0.047*\n0.028\n0.045\n0.034\n)\n0.010\n0.037\n0.054**\n0.025\n0.197**\n0.083\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nAttend any classa\n2\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.062\n0.061\n0.032***\n0.011\n0.109***\n0.039\n)\n0.016\n0.038\n0.081**\n0.035\n0.000\n0.011\n0.024**\n0.010\n)\n0.050*\n0.028\n0.035\n0.033\n)\n0.020\n0.036\n0.051**\n0.024\n0.191**\n0.080\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\nObservations\nImpute values for missing data\n\n762 \nNo \n\n806\nYes\n\na  OLS regression of attending any class on the indicated set of variables, conditional on \nassignment to either treatment group. \nb  High skill indicates individuals with high school or greater formal education or previous \nfinancial trading.\nc  Indices are unweighted mean of z-scores of all component elements, scaled by control \ngroup mean and standard deviation, as detailed in Section IVC.

The first wave, comprising 302 treatment assign-\nments, was conducted from March to May 2007, and the second wave, comprising \nthe remainder, ran from July to August of the same year.13\n\nAll courses were taught by qualified local instructors. The majority had university \ndegrees and experience with adult education, in most cases with ADOPEM directly. \nCourses were offered at seven schools throughout Santo Domingo and scheduled \nbased on preferences elicited during the baseline survey. In addition, the course was \nheavily subsidized. Fees were randomly assigned at RD$200 \n(\nor zero, relative to an overall program cost of approximately RD$700.14\n\napproximately US$6\n\n)\n\nIn  order  to  begin  understanding  the  potential  limitations  to  classroom-based, \nfinancial training, we also randomly assigned half of the people in each of the treat-\nment groups to receive follow-up training consisting of in-person visits of a financial \ntrainer to the micro-entrepreneur\u2019s business. When necessary, the trainers reviewed \nthe  class  materials  with  the  entrepreneurs,  helped  clarify  any  questions  they  had, \nand reviewed their account records, if any. The purpose of the on-site visits was to \nensure that individuals understood the material and were capable of implementing \ntheir newly-acquired financial accounting skills in their businesses. This structure \nhelps us to differentiate the channel by which training affects the participants. If we \ndo not find an effect of training we can determine whether this result is due to the \ninability of the participants to understand what was taught in class or whether the \nmaterial itself, even when properly understood, is not helpful.\n\nIII.  Data and Empirical Strategy\n\nWe constructed the original sample frame based on administrative data collected \nby ADOPEM in the ordinary course of operations. Beginning in November 2006, \nwe conducted a baseline survey of each study participant using a professional sur-\nvey firm unaffiliated with ADOPEM. We collected information on household and \nbusiness characteristics, business practices and performance, business skills, train-\ning history, and interest in future training. The endline survey was conducted during \nthe summer of 2008, at least 12 months after training was completed. We augmented \nthe surveys with administrative data from ADOPEM.\n\nA. Descriptive statistics\n\nTable  1  reports  summary  statistics  for  the  full  sample  and  each  of  the  three \nassignment  groups  from  the  baseline  data.  Given  that  the  treatments  were  ran-\ndomly assigned, we expect individuals in the three assignment groups to be similar \n\n13 A third wave of 800 individuals across all three assignment categories was planned for late 2007, but was \n\ncancelled due to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Dean and Noel and Tropical Storm Olga.\n\n14 The original design was intended to test for selection effects. As noted in Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, the \nemerging approach to business development services calls for pricing training services at or above marginal costs. \nHowever, if those entrepreneurs who would most benefit are uncertain of the program\u2019s benefits or subject to tighter \ncredit constraints, this approach may induce adverse selection. Unfortunately, due to logistical issues associated \nwith data gathering we are unable to analyze the selection results along this dimension.\n\n2011\n\n(\n\n)\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f10 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nTable 1\u2014Baseline Summary Statisticsa\n\nFull \nsample\n mean\n2\n\n(\n\n)\n\nStandard \naccounting \ntreatment\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom\ncontrol\n5\n\n(\n\n)\n\nRule-of-\nthumb \ntreatment\n6\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom \ncontrol\n7\n\n(\n\n)\n\nControl\n3\n\n(\n\n)\n\nObservations\n1\n\n(\npanel A.

As shown in the table, this expectation generally holds across our \n18  baseline  characteristics;  however,  there  are  two  marginally  significant  differ-\nences. Individuals assigned to the standard accounting treatment are marginally less \nlikely to report keeping accounting records or separating their business and personal \naccounts in the baseline. Individuals in the rule-of-thumb training also report lower \nrevenues in both average and bad weeks, although these differences fall below the \n10  percent  significance  level.15  Therefore,  we  control  for  these  characteristics  in \nthe regression analytics that follow. Based on our sample size of approximately 400 \nindividuals per assignment group, any small-sample bias introduced by inclusion of \nthese baseline characteristics as covariates is minimal.16\n\n(\n\n)\n\nUS$85\n\napproximately US$750\n\nAs  shown  in  the  table,  the  average  person  in  our  sample  is  40  years  old,  has \nthree children, and holds a loan size of RD$26,514, \n; the \nmedian was RD$20,000. The median borrower in the sample reported revenues dur-\n. In addition, 90 percent of the sample is \ning an average week of RD$3,000 \n)\n(\nfemale, 35 percent have more than a high school degree, and 66 percent have at least \nsome savings. While all participants had been chosen by ADOPEM as clients who \npotentially  were  interested  in  financial  training,  only  about  47  percent  explicitly \nstated interest in training when surveyed. Reported sales are RD$6,399 in an aver-\nage week and RD$3,500 in a bad week. Approximately half of the participants oper-\nate businesses engaged in retail sales and trading. We also found \nnot reported in the \n(\ntable\n that 60 percent of the businesses are sole proprietorships with no employees \nin addition to the borrower. Of the rest, 80 percent have 1 or 2 employees in addi-\ntion to the borrower and few have more than 5. Typical businesses include small \ncolmados\nretail  shops,  general  stores \n,  beauty  salons,  and  food  service,  serving \n)\ngeographically-clustered, local markets.\n\n)\n\n(\n\nThe  final  panel  of Table  1  reports  the  business  practices  of  the  small  business \nowners. A majority of them report already implementing several financial manage-\nment  practices:  74  percent  report  that  they  are  separating  personal  and  business \ncash;  66  percent  keep  accounting  records;  53  percent  have  separate  business  and \npersonal accounts, and 80 percent say they calculate their revenues formally.\n\nThe endline survey was conducted in mid-2008, one year after the last wave of \ntraining was completed. Anecdotal evidence and discussions with ADOPEM sug-\ngest an unusually high level of program dropout, business closure, and out-migration \nfrom the Dominican Republic by the sample population in response to Hurricanes \nDean and Noel and Tropical Storm Olga, which flooded large parts of the country \n\n]\n\n[\n\n/\n\n15 Average, good, and bad periods were self defined by the respondents. For good and bad periods, the questions \nwere framed as follows: \u201cNow we want to know how much your business sells when things are going well and when \nthings are not going so well. Try to give us your best estimate. Do not worry if you do not know the exact value. \nHow much do you sell in a \n\n week?\u201d\n\ngood\n\nbad\n\n16 Appendix Table A2 demonstrates a clear pattern of selection into training and highlights the need for exog-\nenous  variation  in  treatment  assignment  to  assess  the  causal  mechanisms  though  which  training  can  affect  out-\ncomes. Conditional on assignment to the treatment group, those who attend have more education. They are also \nmore likely to have expressed an interest in accounting training during the baseline survey; however, a prior interest \nin increasing savings or improving cash management is not associated with increased attendance. They also tend \nto have lower revenues but bigger plans, as measured by the share of the loan intended for fixed asset purchases. \nAttendance does not vary with individuals\u2019 business type. Interestingly, we see some evidence for the reverse of an \n\u201cAshenfelter dip\u201d: individuals reporting that their business had improved in the month preceding the baseline survey \nwere 6.4 percentage points more likely to attend the training.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple"

The  rule-of-thumb \nimproved \nfirms\u2019  financial  practices,  objective  reporting  quality,  and  revenues. \nFor  micro-entrepreneurs  with  lower  skills  or  poor  initial  financial \npractices,  the  impact  of  the  rule-of-thumb  training  was  significantly \nlarger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that \nsimplifying  training  programs  might  improve  their  effectiveness  for \nless  sophisticated  individuals. \nJEL  D4,  G21,  J24,  L25,  L26,  M41, \n(\nO16\n\ntraining  significantly \n\n)\n\nIndividuals  and  micro-entrepreneurs  alike  are  asked  to  make  complex  financial \n\ndecisions in many areas of life, whether in their personal finances in the form of \nsavings decisions and retirement planning or in a business context as small business \nowners or investors.

The evidence so far has been mixed, with large \nheterogeneity in the estimated success of training programs. For example, Bernheim \nand  Garrett \n  provide  survey  evidence  that  people  who \nattend financial counseling programs subsequently make better financial decisions, \nespecially  those  attendees  with  low  income  and  education  levels.  The  estimated \neffects of the programs are large; however, self-selection into training could lead to \nan upward bias. In contrast, Duflo and Saez \n conduct a randomized evaluation \n(\nexposing  employees  to  a  benefits  fair  that  raises  awareness  about  retirement  sav-\nings, but they find only a small effect on savings plan enrollment. Similarly, Cole, \nSampson, and Zia \n find only modest effects from a financial literacy training \nprogram in Indonesia.\n\n2003\n\n2011\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n)\n\nOne major challenge in studying the impact of such financial literacy programs is \nthat measured impacts conflate the usefulness of the financial skills with the effec-\ntiveness  of  the  specific  training  methodology  used  in  the  study. To  date  we  have \nonly  very  limited  systematic  knowledge  about  the  dimensions  that  determine  the \nimpact of a financial literacy program. This impact might be crucially affected by \nthe comprehensiveness and complexity of the materials, and all training programs \nface a trade-off between the ease with which participants can grasp the concepts and \ntheir potential depth of understanding.\n\n)\n\n2007a\n\nTo advance our knowledge of how differences in the structure and complexity of \ntraining programs affect participants\u2019 performance, we worked with a bank in the \nDominican Republic to conduct a randomized evaluation comparing the impact of \ntwo financial literacy training programs for small business owners. While we do not \nfocus specifically on consumer financial literacy of the sort studied by Lusardi and \nMitchell \n and others, we note that for microenterprises the boundary between \n(\nbusiness  and  personal  financial  decisions  is  often  blurred.  In  order  to  understand \nthe channel through which financial training may affect recipients, we worked with \nADOPEM, a microfinance institution in the Dominican Republic with a long history \nof offering training to its clients, to develop two distinct types of training that span \nthe spectrum between comprehensiveness of the material and ease of understand-\ning. Our aim in designing and evaluating these two programs is to assess whether \nthere may be advantages to reducing the complexity of training programs and, in \nparticular, if the simpler rule-of-thumb training is a better fit for less-educated or \nless financially sophisticated clients.\n\nThe standard accounting program closely follows a standard approach to small \nbusiness  training,  which  is  designed  to  teach  micro-entrepreneurs  the  basics  of \ndouble-entry accounting, working capital management, and investment decisions. \nSimilar programs are used around the world by groups such as Freedom from Hunger, \nthe International Labor Organization, BRAC, and many others.1 The rule-of-thumb \ntraining focuses on very simple heuristics or routines for financial decision  making \n\n1 The traditional accounting training was based on the then-current curricula of Freedom from Hunger and the \nILO\u2019s Start and Improve Your Business program. Working with the training center at ADOPEM, we adapted these \nprograms to the Dominican context in terms of language, idiom, and the specific examples used in teaching.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n3\n\nwithout aiming to provide comprehensive accounting knowledge. For example, the \nstandard accounting trainings taught participants to separate their business and per-\nsonal  accounts  by  instructing  them  how  to  calculate  business  profits  based  on  a \ntypical accounting curriculum for micro-entrepreneurs. The rule-of-thumb training \ngave them a physical rule to keep their money in two separate drawers \n)\nand  to  only  transfer  money  from  one  drawer  to  the  other  with  an  explicit  \u201cIOU\u201d \nnote between the business and the household. At the end of the month they could \nthen count how much money was in the business drawer and know what their profits \nwere.\n\nor purses\n(\n\nBetween November 2006 and July 2008, we implemented a randomized evalu-\nation of these two training programs in collaboration with ADOPEM. We selected \n1,193 of their existing clients who had expressed some interest in training and ran-\ndomly  assigned  them  either  to  one  of  the  two  trainings  or  a  control  group.  Our \nresults document important differences in the impact of the two approaches. People \nwho were offered rule-of-thumb-based training showed significant improvements in \nthe way they managed their finances and in the accuracy and internal consistency \nof the numbers they reported. They were more likely to keep accounting records, \ncalculate monthly revenues, and separate their books for the business and the home. \nImprovements along these dimensions are on the order of 10 percentage points. In \ncontrast, we did not find any significant changes for those in the standard accounting \ntraining. We note that while only the rule-of-thumb training generated significant \nimprovements in business practices and reporting quality, the differences between \nthe two treatments in the full sample were not statistically significant. However, for \nthe subset of clients that are lower skilled or had poorer financial practices in the \nbaseline, we show that the rule-of-thumb training had a larger and significantly more \npositive impact than the standard accounting training. Overall, it appears that the \nmicro-entrepreneurs in our study were more likely to implement what they learned \nin the rule-of-thumb training.\n\nIn  studying  training  programs,  measurement  effects  are  a  natural  concern. \nRespondents  may  report  what  they  believe  surveyors  want  to  hear.  Therefore, \nwe  developed  and  looked  for  changes  in  objective  measures  of  reporting  quality. \nConsistent  with  the  belief  that  SMEs  lack  financial  controls,  the  quality  of  self-\nreported  firm  data  is  poor.  In  the  baseline  survey,  nearly  half  of  the  respondents \nmake at least one error when asked to report sales and profits over different time \nhorizons and levels of aggregation. Similarly, self-reported profits are, on average, \nsubstantially lower than what one would calculate from respondents\u2019 own revenue \nand expense detail.2 The standard accounting training generates small and not statis-\ntically significant improvements in both dimensions. In contrast, the rule-of-thumb \ntraining  significantly  improves  objective  reporting  quality. The  error  rate  falls  by \n9 percentage points, and the mean difference between the two profit measures drops \n\n)\n\n2 The direction of this reporting bias goes in the opposite direction from what De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff \n found in their sample of small firms in Sri Lanka, for which self-reported profits are larger than those calcu-\n2009\n(\nlated from revenue and expense detail. We speculate that the firms in our sample have less incentive to underreport \nrevenues but have poor recall over expense detail and fail to record the necessary information. Note also that there \nis substantial variation in these errors. In the control group, directly reported profits are less than calculated profits \nfor 58 percent of the sample and larger for 28 percent.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f4 \n\nAmericAn economic JournAl: Applied economics \n\nApril 2014\n\nby more than 50 percent. These improvements in objective reporting quality suggest \nthat the rule-of-thumb training changes actual business management practices. They \nalso underscore a key challenge in using profits as an outcome measure in business \ntraining studies. Not only are profits difficult to measure\u2014this is well understood\u2014\nbut estimated effects often conflate the effect of the treatment on actual profits with \nchanges in reporting quality.\n\nWhen looking at the impact of training on business outcomes, we again find a \nmore significant change in the group that received the rule-of-thumb training. We \nfind a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact of 0.11 standard \ndeviations on an index of revenue measures. The most significant effect is observed \nin the level of sales during self-reported bad weeks. While these results should be \ninterpreted with caution\u2014the training may have affected revenue reporting as well \nas actual revenues\u2014we note that this is consistent with an emerging pattern in other \n. \nrecent studies \n)\nThe  standard  accounting  training  produces  no  significant  effects. The  differences \nbetween the two trainings is large and statistically significant.\n\nKarlan and Valdivia 2011; Berge, Bjorvatn, and Tungodden 2012\n\n(\n\nIn  a  second  step,  we  test  for  heterogeneous  treatment  effects,  comparing  the \nrelative  effect  of  the  trainings  across  clients  with  different  characteristics.  The \n rule-of-thumb  training  produces  a  more  pronounced  effect  for  less  sophisticated \nclients: those with the lowest human capital, limited ex ante interest in accounting \nor financial training, or with baseline business practices in the lowest quartile.3 For \nthese  clients,  the  differences  between  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting \ntrainings are economically and statistically significant. These findings highlight the \nimportance of heterogeneity and targeting training materials to client characteris-\ntics. A simplified rule-of-thumb training appears well suited to the needs of the less \nsophisticated clients.4\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that effective training may operate by help-\ning  individuals  to  better  manage  negative  shocks  or  by  improving  their  financial \ncontrols, which may allow them to predict and counteract the effect of slow weeks \nmore proactively. However, it is important to note that improvements for firms in the \nrule-of-thumb treatment could stem from net business growth or from a redistribu-\ntion from other enterprises in their area. Our study design allows us to test for these \nnegative spillovers. We find a small but statistically significant drop in sales for firms \nlocated near more treated firms if these treated firms are in the same general line of \nbusiness. These results are suggestive that some of the growth in the treated firms \n\n3 The original sample frame of 1,193 individuals comprised borrowers who expressed interest in generic busi-\nness training before the start of the program. In the baseline survey, respondents were asked to indicate their interest \nin specific forms of training. We classify an individual as \u201cinterested in training\u201d if she indicated a desire to receive \ntraining in business accounting or financial management.\n\n4 Simplicity could benefit trainees in two ways, either by making concepts more accessible or by allowing more \ntime for repetition of each topic. This difference is conceptually important; however with a fixed time budget, the \ntwo are jointly determined. To disentangle these mechanisms, we aimed to keep the teaching time of each topic \nsimilar across the two training programs. The rule-of-thumb training was implemented in a total of five training \nsessions versus six for the standard accounting program. Furthermore, we implemented an additional treatment arm \nthat provided focused, hands-on repetition of all the concepts to a subset of both primary treatment groups. The \nresults, reported in Appendix Table A4, show no significant improvements from relaxing the time constraint. This \nsuggests that in this context simplicity per se and not repetition is driving the results.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n5\n\nwas due to crowding out of other firms and identify an important avenue for future \nwork.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Since then, they have increased their focus on financial \nservices and related activities, incorporating as a bank in 2004.

The  standard  accounting  treatment \noffered a traditional, principles-based course in basic accounting techniques.

In devel-\noping countries, where the tax and legal motivations for account separation often \nare weaker, it continues to receive a great deal of attention. The proposed benefits \nof account separation are twofold. On the one hand, it is seen as a very crude but \neasy way to monitor whether the business is self-sustainable and provides an esti-\nmate of the profitability of the business. The second rationale is more behavioral: \nkeeping accounts separate serves as a commitment device for the business owner \n not to overconsume and deplete the working capital in the business. In \nor relatives\n(\naddition to presenting several strategies for physically separating business and per-\nsonal funds, the rule-of-thumb treatment taught how to estimate business profits by \nsimple changes in business cash on hand, paying oneself a fixed salary, distinguish-\ning  business  and  personal  expenses,  and  easy-to-implement  tools  for  reconciling \naccounts when business funds have been used for personal expenses or the reverse. \nIn both treatments, clients received record-keeping books, handouts, and homework \nassignments to reinforce ideas or techniques from the meetings. Both classes were \noffered once a week for three hours at a time. The standard accounting treatment \nlasted for six weeks and the rule-of-thumb treatment for five. The first three classes \nof both treatments covered consumption, savings, and debt management. The final \nthree classes of the standard accounting treatment comprised basic cash account-\ning, distinguishing business and personal expenses, calculating profits, and working \ncapital management. Classes four and five of the rule-of-thumb treatment focused \non separating business and personal money and estimation techniques for calculat-\ning profits.11 Attendance for classes one through five did not differ across the two \ntreatments.\n\nThe  sample  consisted  of  1,193  existing  ADOPEM  business  or  personal  loan \n clients from Santo Domingo.12 Of these, we assigned 402 to the accounting treat-\nment, 404 to the rule-of-thumb treatment, and 387 to a control group that received \nno additional training services.

ADOPEM \n\n10 The ADOPEM training program is most closely related to the budgeting module of the FFH training program. \nThis module includes training on: how to develop a financial plan for the household expenses, how to adapt the \nspending to a restricted income, how to develop a budget for the house and the business, how to prioritize spending, \nhow to record income and expenses, how to use income and expenses bookkeeping to make financial decisions, and \nhow to store financial documents. Importantly, both ADOPEM training programs focused on maintaining a clear \nseparation of business accounts.\n\n11 See Table A1 for a more detailed summary of the materials covered.\n12 At the request of ADOPEM, group loan clients with loans smaller than RD$15,000 were excluded from the \nstudy. The original sample comprised 1,200 individuals; however, 7 observations were discarded due to errors in \nthe baseline survey.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n9\n\nmade no additional policy changes concurrent with the training program. The treat-\nment was conducted in two waves. The first wave, comprising 302 treatment assign-\nments, was conducted from March to May 2007, and the second wave, comprising \nthe remainder, ran from July to August of the same year.13\n\nAll courses were taught by qualified local instructors. The majority had university \ndegrees and experience with adult education, in most cases with ADOPEM directly. \nCourses were offered at seven schools throughout Santo Domingo and scheduled \nbased on preferences elicited during the baseline survey. In addition, the course was \nheavily subsidized. Fees were randomly assigned at RD$200 \n(\nor zero, relative to an overall program cost of approximately RD$700.14\n\napproximately US$6\n\n)\n\nIn  order  to  begin  understanding  the  potential  limitations  to  classroom-based, \nfinancial training, we also randomly assigned half of the people in each of the treat-\nment groups to receive follow-up training consisting of in-person visits of a financial \ntrainer to the micro-entrepreneur\u2019s business. When necessary, the trainers reviewed \nthe  class  materials  with  the  entrepreneurs,  helped  clarify  any  questions  they  had, \nand reviewed their account records, if any. The purpose of the on-site visits was to \nensure that individuals understood the material and were capable of implementing \ntheir newly-acquired financial accounting skills in their businesses. This structure \nhelps us to differentiate the channel by which training affects the participants. If we \ndo not find an effect of training we can determine whether this result is due to the \ninability of the participants to understand what was taught in class or whether the \nmaterial itself, even when properly understood, is not helpful.\n\nIII.  Data and Empirical Strategy\n\nWe constructed the original sample frame based on administrative data collected \nby ADOPEM in the ordinary course of operations. Beginning in November 2006, \nwe conducted a baseline survey of each study participant using a professional sur-\nvey firm unaffiliated with ADOPEM. We collected information on household and \nbusiness characteristics, business practices and performance, business skills, train-\ning history, and interest in future training. The endline survey was conducted during \nthe summer of 2008, at least 12 months after training was completed. We augmented \nthe surveys with administrative data from ADOPEM.\n\nA. Descriptive statistics\n\nTable  1  reports  summary  statistics  for  the  full  sample  and  each  of  the  three \nassignment  groups  from  the  baseline  data.  Given  that  the  treatments  were  ran-\ndomly assigned, we expect individuals in the three assignment groups to be similar \n\n13 A third wave of 800 individuals across all three assignment categories was planned for late 2007, but was \n\ncancelled due to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Dean and Noel and Tropical Storm Olga.\n\n14 The original design was intended to test for selection effects. As noted in Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, the \nemerging approach to business development services calls for pricing training services at or above marginal costs. \nHowever, if those entrepreneurs who would most benefit are uncertain of the program\u2019s benefits or subject to tighter \ncredit constraints, this approach may induce adverse selection. Unfortunately, due to logistical issues associated \nwith data gathering we are unable to analyze the selection results along this dimension.\n\n2011\n\n(\n\n)\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f10 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nTable 1\u2014Baseline Summary Statisticsa\n\nFull \nsample\n mean\n2\n\n(\n\n)\n\nStandard \naccounting \ntreatment\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom\ncontrol\n5\n\n(\n\n)\n\nRule-of-\nthumb \ntreatment\n6\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom \ncontrol\n7\n\n(\n\n)\n\nControl\n3\n\n(\n\n)\n\nObservations\n1\n\n(\npanel A.

As shown in the table, this expectation generally holds across our \n18  baseline  characteristics;  however,  there  are  two  marginally  significant  differ-\nences. Individuals assigned to the standard accounting treatment are marginally less \nlikely to report keeping accounting records or separating their business and personal \naccounts in the baseline. Individuals in the rule-of-thumb training also report lower \nrevenues in both average and bad weeks, although these differences fall below the \n10  percent  significance  level.15  Therefore,  we  control  for  these  characteristics  in \nthe regression analytics that follow.

While all participants had been chosen by ADOPEM as clients who \npotentially  were  interested  in  financial  training,  only  about  47  percent  explicitly \nstated interest in training when surveyed. Reported sales are RD$6,399 in an aver-\nage week and RD$3,500 in a bad week. Approximately half of the participants oper-\nate businesses engaged in retail sales and trading. We also found \nnot reported in the \n(\ntable\n that 60 percent of the businesses are sole proprietorships with no employees \nin addition to the borrower. Of the rest, 80 percent have 1 or 2 employees in addi-\ntion to the borrower and few have more than 5. Typical businesses include small \ncolmados\nretail  shops,  general  stores \n,  beauty  salons,  and  food  service,  serving \n)\ngeographically-clustered, local markets.\n\n)\n\n(\n\nThe  final  panel  of Table  1  reports  the  business  practices  of  the  small  business \nowners.

Anecdotal evidence and discussions with ADOPEM sug-\ngest an unusually high level of program dropout, business closure, and out-migration \nfrom the Dominican Republic by the sample population in response to Hurricanes \nDean and Noel and Tropical Storm Olga, which flooded large parts of the country \n\n[\n\n]\n\n/\n\n15 Average, good, and bad periods were self defined by the respondents. For good and bad periods, the questions \nwere framed as follows: \u201cNow we want to know how much your business sells when things are going well and when \nthings are not going so well. Try to give us your best estimate. Do not worry if you do not know the exact value. \nHow much do you sell in a \n\n week?\u201d\n\ngood\n\nbad\n\n16 Appendix Table A2 demonstrates a clear pattern of selection into training and highlights the need for exog-\nenous  variation  in  treatment  assignment  to  assess  the  causal  mechanisms  though  which  training  can  affect  out-\ncomes. Conditional on assignment to the treatment group, those who attend have more education. They are also \nmore likely to have expressed an interest in accounting training during the baseline survey; however, a prior interest \nin increasing savings or improving cash management is not associated with increased attendance. They also tend \nto have lower revenues but bigger plans, as measured by the share of the loan intended for fixed asset purchases. \nAttendance does not vary with individuals\u2019 business type. Interestingly, we see some evidence for the reverse of an \n\u201cAshenfelter dip\u201d: individuals reporting that their business had improved in the month preceding the baseline survey \nwere 6.4 percentage points more likely to attend the training.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f12 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nand  caused  catastrophic  damage. The  survey  team  utilized  various  forms  of  con-\ntact information from baseline and administrative data as well as credit officers in \nthe field in its efforts to locate all individuals in the study for the endline survey. \nUltimately, we collected endline data for 87 percent of participants reporting in the \nbaseline.17\n\nB. objective Reporting Measures\n\nSelf-reporting  bias  raises  concerns  about  any  measures  of  business  manage-\nment practices. Treated individuals may, for example, report maintaining separate \nbusiness and personal accounts because they were told this was important and not \nbecause they actually do so. To allay such concerns, we construct an objective index \nof financial reporting errors. We classify as an error any report of bad period sales \ngreater  than  average  or  good;  average  period  sales  better  than  good;  or  average \nperiod  profits better than good period sales for each of daily, weekly, and monthly \nreported outcomes. In the baseline, 45 percent of subjects make at least one mis-\ntake and 11 percent make three or more. Along the same lines, we compare self-\nreported profits to profits calculated from respondents\u2019 own revenue and expense \ndetail. These differences are large; self-reported profits are only 60 percent of those \ncalculated from the disaggregated components. While these differences could result \nfrom  misreporting  any  of  the  components,  we  believe  the  most  plausible  expla-\nnation  is  that  respondents  fail  to  remember  and,  hence,  underreport  their  various \ndetailed business expenses. This poses challenges when interpreting the impact of \neither treatment on profits. For example, training could increase actual profits while \nimproving recall of business expenses, leaving reported profits unchanged. For this \nreason, we are cautious when interpreting any profit measure as a stand-alone out-\ncome. To account for this possibility, we estimate the effect of each treatment on the \nraw and absolute difference between self-reported and calculated profits. Because \nwe  do  not  have  a  measure  of  true  profits,  we  cannot  make  statements  about  the \naccuracy of these measures; however, we expect that if either treatment improves \nfinancial controls, the difference between the two profit measures become smaller.\n\nC. Empirical strategy\n\nRandom assignment of the treatments allows us to obtain unbiased estimates of \nthe effect of being offered the training program by estimating the following equation:\n\n1\n\n(\n\n) \n\ny\n\nE \ny\n i \nX\n i \n  +   \u03b2 2  Ro T\n i \n  =  \u03b1  +   \u03b2 1  Acc t\n  i  \n  +  \u03b4  \n  +  \u03b3  \n\nB \n  +   \u03b5 i   ,\n  i  \n\nE   is  the  endline  value  of  the  outcome  variable  of  interest;  Acc t\n  i  \n\n i   is  an \nwhere   y\n i   is  an  indicator  for \n indicator  for  being  assigned  to  the  accounting  treatment;  Ro T\n i  is a matrix of baseline-measured \nbeing assigned to the rule-of-thumb treatment;  X\ncovariates  including  business  types,  loan  size,  and  participation  in  an ADOPEM \n\n17 Section IVD discusses attrition in more detail.\n\n \n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n13\n\n\u03b2\n\nB ,  explains \nsavings  account.

These \nspillovers  can  take  two  forms.  First,  there  may  be  positive  knowledge  spillovers. \nTrained  clients  may  actively  pass  on  newly  acquired  knowledge  to  their  peers  or \nneighboring businesses may observe and mimic improved management practices. \nSecond,  business  outcomes  for  the  treated  may  improve  either  by  expanding  the \noverall  market,  \u201cgrowing  the  pie\u201d,  or  by  a  reallocation  of  revenues  from  control \nfirms to the treated, \u201cbusiness stealing\u201d.

The  estimated  effect  on  the  business  practices  index  is  0.07, \np-value: \napproximately  0.12  standard  deviations,  but  not  statistically  significant \n( \n0.198\n. Among the component elements, only the estimated effect on setting aside \n)\nfunds for business expenses is significant at the 10 percent level or better. Estimates \nfor the other business practice outcomes, while all positive, are not statistically sig-\nnificant and generally close to zero.\n\nIn  contrast,  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  reported  in  column  4,  substantially \nincreases the likelihood that individuals adopt better financial practices. Clients in \nthat treatment group report a higher likelihood of separating business and personal \ncash, keeping accounting records, separating business and personal accounts, set-\nting aside cash for business, and calculating revenues formally. Each of these mea-\nsures  increases  by  6 to 12  percentage  points  relative  to  the  control  group,  which \ndid not receive training, and all are significant at the 5 percent level or better. The \nrule-of-thumb  treatment  also  produces  a  significant  0.14  increase  in  the  business \npractices index, approximately 0.25 standard deviations. When looking at savings \nbehavior, we find a marginally significant impact of the rule-of-thumb training on \nthe likelihood of having any savings. The increase in total reported savings, while \nlarge, is not significant. Column 5 reports the p-values for tests of the equality of the \nstandard accounting and rule-of-thumb treatment effects. When considering the full \nsample, the rule-of-thumb training has a consistently more positive effect. The dif-\nferential impact on both separating business and personal cash and keeping account-\ning  records  are  significant  at  the  10  percent  level  or  better,  but  despite  the  rather \nlarge difference we cannot reject equality for the impact on the index of business \npractices.\n\n)\n\nThe second set of results shows the impact of training on measures of objective \nreporting  quality.  Fifty  percent  of  the  control  group  made  at  least  one  objective \nreporting error in their responses to survey questions regarding financial outcomes \n. Individuals in both treatment groups \nsee Section IIIB for a detailed description\n(\nare less likely to make any such mistakes. However, only for the rule-of-thumb train-\ning is the improvement significant, with treated individuals 8 percentage points less \nlikely to make any errors. Similarly, both treatments appear to reduce differences \nbetween directly reported profits and profits calculated from respondents\u2019 reported \nrevenues  and  expenses.

This increase of RD$967 to RD$979 is economically large\u201425 percent of \nmean endline reports and nearly 60 percent of the median\u2014and significant at the \n10 percent level. Those assigned to the rule-of-thumb training also reported higher \nsales in average weeks, but the effect is not statistically significant.\n\nThese  results  should  be  interpreted  with  some  caution.  As  noted,  individuals \nassigned  to  the  rule-of-thumb  training  reported  lower  sales  in  these  periods  than \nthose assigned to the control group. These differences in baseline revenues are not \nsignificant at conventional levels; however, the treatment effect is insignificant when \ni.e., \nthe controls for baseline sales are dropped. Moreover, the quality of a period \ngood, average or bad\n was defined by the respondent, and our results are consistent \nwith both a change in how respondents classified periods and an improvement in \nactual revenues. With this caveat in mind, these results parallel those of Karlan and \nValdivia \n,  both  of  which  find \n)\nrevenue improvements in bad periods as a result of training. The findings remain \nconsistent with the possibility that effective training may operate by helping indi-\nviduals to better manage negative shocks or by alerting them to such shocks such \nthat they can counteract the effect of slow weeks. In contrast, the standard account-\ning program has no discernible effects on revenues in the broad sample.\n\n  and  Berge,  Bjorvatn,  and Tungodden \n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\nTable 3 describes the effects of training on institutional outcomes.

There is no evidence that the rule-of-thumb training \ncauses any other changes in institutional outcomes.\n\nB. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects\n\nThe  efficacy  of  different  training  programs  is  likely  to  vary  through  the  popu-\nlation.  Table  4  reports  whether  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting  train-\nings  have  heterogeneous  treatment  effects  for  different  subgroups.  We  focus  on \nthree dimensions along which we expected training may have differential effects. \nFirst, we classify an individual as high-skilled if she has completed high school or \nreceived previous formal financial training and low-skilled otherwise. Differences \nin  treatment  effects  along  this  dimension  allow  us  to  test  whether  the  effective-\nness of training depends on initial levels of human capital. Second, we classify an \nindividual as interested in training if she indicated in the baseline survey a desire to \nreceive training in business accounting or financial management and not otherwise. \nDifferences along this dimension allow us to test whether the effectiveness of train-\ning depends on a participant\u2019s motivation. Third, we compare individuals across the \nquartiles of baseline business management practices.\n\nColumns 2 and 3 compare the impact of the trainings across different levels of \ninitial  human  capital.  The  first  row  in  each  panel  focuses  on  whether  the  clients \nadopted  better  business  practices. The  impacts  of  the  rule-of-thumb  treatment  on \n business  practices  appear  independent  of  skill  level;  both  subgroups  show  large \nand significant improvements. We then look at our different measures of objective \nreporting quality. Across both skill levels, we find that the rule-of-thumb treatment, \non average, reduced the likelihood that individuals made reporting errors, although \nthe results are only significant for low-skill individuals. Finally, we also test whether \nthere is a differential impact on business outcomes. The coefficients for the impact \non the revenue measures are positive for both groups, but none of the effects is sig-\nnificant when splitting the sample by skill level.24\n\nColumns 4 and 5 repeat the heterogeneous treatment analysis along the dimension \nof interest in training. Again, we find a positive effect on both groups, with similar \nand significant magnitudes. Objective reporting quality improves for both groups, \nwith  a  larger  effect for those expressing  greater interest in training. There are  no \nsignificant differences in the business performance measures across the groups.\n\nThis stands in contrast to the results of Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, which finds \n)\nthat less interested clients benefitted more from the training. We hypothesize that this  \n\n2011\n(\n\n24 The results for employment, not reported here but available from the authors, are interesting. The rule-of-\nthumb treatment reduces the number of employees for the low-skill group but increases employment in the busi-\nnesses  of  the  high-skilled  group.

It suggests that in certain \ncircumstances the price mechanism may effectively allocate training programs.\n\nThe  last  three  columns  of  Table  4  show  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  had  a \nlarger impact on businesses with poorer management practices in the baseline.25 On \n\n25 Results for the second quartile of baseline business practices are suppressed due to space constraints.

The effects on objective reporting quality and busi-\nness performance are insufficiently precise to draw further conclusions. This might \nsuggest that the rule-of-thumb training allows the people with poor practices ex ante \nto catch up with the others. The ability of the rule-of-thumb training to benefit even \nthe most poorly managed businesses is primarily responsible for its larger average \ntreatment effect and supports the hypothesis that there may be advantages to reduc-\ning the complexity of training programs when targeting micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nThe second panel of Table 4 repeats the exact same set of regressions for the dif-\nferent subsamples for the standard accounting treatment group. There are several \npoints of note. First, the standard accounting treatment improves objective report-\ning quality, but only for high-skilled individuals. The accounting training actually \nincreases reporting errors for businesses in the lowest quartile of baseline business \npractices. Second, those who expressed greater interest in the training ex ante appear \nto change their business practices in response to the accounting training, while those \nwith  less  interest  are  unaffected. This  stands  in  contrast  to  the  pattern  of  hetero-\ngeneity  for  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  which  produced  comparable  and  in  some \ncases larger improvements for those who expressed less interest in training. Finally, \nlower-skilled clients in the accounting training report meaningful drops in their rev-\nenues. These effects are substantial, approximately 0.2 standard deviations from the \nbaseline reported values. Similarly, we find a significant reduction in sales for the \nquartile of clients with the worst business practices in the baseline.\n\nThese results are quite surprising and could be driven by several different chan-\nnels. On the one hand, there could be a negative causal effect of accounting training \non  less  educated  clients  if  they  spend  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  implement  standard \naccounting  techniques  without  much  success. Alternatively  one  could  conjecture \nthat trained clients are more realistic about their actual revenues while prior to the \ntraining they might have been overly optimistic. The relatively large effect on the \nraw difference in reported profits for this subgroup is consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that treated clients may be more aware of their true revenues but the observed \nincrease in reporting errors points in the other direction. Ultimately, we cannot rule \nout either channel.\n\nC. Differences between Rule-of-Thumb and standard Accounting Training\n\nWe  have  shown  above  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  stronger  positive \nimpact across several dimensions than the accounting training, especially on clients \nwith low education and worse business practices relative to the control group. We \nnow compare these two trainings directly to each other. The final panel of Table 4 \nreports the difference in the treatment effect between the rule-of-thumb and account-\ning trainings, and the p-values for testing the equality of treatment effects for all \nsubgroups. Looking across the subgroups, we find a very strong and consistent pat-\ntern according to individuals\u2019 interest in training \n. The rule-of-\n)\nthumb training had a substantially more positive impact than the accounting training \nfor clients that reported limited interest in training ex ante. There is a significantly \nlarger  effect  of  0.12  in  the  index  of  business  practices,  0.21  standard  deviations \n\ncolumns 4 and 5\n\n(\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n21\n\np-value: 0.055\n( \n\np-value: 0.052\n, and a 0.17 difference in the revenue index, 0.20 standard devia-\n)\n( \ntions \n. A similar pattern is observed in bad week sales, with results \nsignificant at approximately the 5 percent level. For those with a strong prior inter-\nest in training, the differences between the two trainings are not significant. On the \nwhole, the rule-of-thumb training generates substantially better outcomes for those \nwith a lower interest in training.\n\n)\n\nWhile not evident in the measures of business practices, we find similar outcomes \nalong the skill dimension in terms of objective reporting quality and business perfor-\nmance. Low-skilled individuals in the rule-of-thumb treatment were 12 percentage \npoints less likely to commit any reporting errors than those in the standard account-\n. This translates into differences in reported revenues, \ning training \np-value: \nwith a difference of 0.17 in the revenue index, 0.20 standard deviations \n( \n0.044\n\np-value: 0.016\n( \n\n)\n\nFinally, we look across quartiles of baseline business practices. In line with the \nfindings above, we see that the clients in the lowest quartile receiving the rule-of-\nthumb training see substantially larger and significant improvements in business and \nfinancial practices relative to those in the accounting training. Again, these results \ntranslate into substantially better sales outcomes. Within the middle quartiles there \nare no significant differences between the two trainings. Surprisingly, the difference \nin  business  practices  reemerges  in  the  top  quartile,  but  these  differences  are  not \nobserved in objective reporting quality or revenues.\n\n.\n)\n\nTaken  together  the  findings  suggest  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  sig-\nnificant and positive effect relative to the accounting training on clients that start \nfrom lower levels of skill, business practices, and interest in training. The same does \nnot  hold  for  higher  skilled,  better  managed  or  more  interested  businesses,  where \nthe impact of both trainings is similar. Not only is the rule-of-thumb training more \nlikely to improve business practices for clients at the lower end of the spectrum, it \nhas real effects on outcomes. This suggests that it is important to correctly match \nthe  characteristics  of  the  clients  with  the  type  of  training  that  will  be  useful  for \nthem.  Giving  an  unsophisticated  client  standard  accounting  training  can  actually \nreduce their performance, while the rule-of-thumb training substantially improves \ntheir outcomes.\n\nD. Robustness checks\n\nFirst, we discuss attrition. Our response rate was relatively high\u201487 percent of \nparticipants were reached for the endline\u2014but we find some evidence for selective \nattrition.  Treatment  group  individuals  who  were  not  reached  for  the  endline  sur-\nvey have generally higher baseline revenues \n than those who \ndropped  from  the  control  group \n.  Given  the  relatively  low \nrevenue  index \nlevel of attrition, this difference of 0.18 standard deviations is not statistically sig-\nnificant.  Nonetheless,  it  suggests  that  the  reported  results  for  business  outcomes \nmay understate the program\u2019s true effect. There are no differences across the two \ntreatment groups.\n\nrevenue index 0.05\n\n0.09\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\nIn addition to survey nonresponse, there is a relatively high incidence of business \nexit:  78  percent  of  individuals  reached  in  the  endline  report  operating  their  own \n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f22 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nbusiness relative to 97 percent in the baseline. As discussed above, qualitative evi-\ndence and discussions with ADOPEM suggest that a string of natural disasters led to \nan unusually high rate of out-migration from the Dominican Republic and business \nexit by the sample population. To test for differential attrition, we estimate a linear \nprobability model of business ownership in the endline on indicators for treatment \nstatus.  Coefficients  for  assignment  to  the  standard  accounting  and  rule-of-thumb \ntrainings are \n\n and 0.001 \nWe analyze the implications for our estimated treatment effects of different plau-\nsible assumptions for the potential outcomes of individuals who are not reached in \nthe endline or who report not having a business. We construct bounds on the treat-\nment effects for the rule-of-thumb training on the business practices index, revenue \nindex, and any reporting errors indicator using a range of assumptions for the pat-\ntern of attrition following an approach based on Horowitz and Manski \n, Lee \n2004\n2002\n\np-value: 0.235\n( \n\np-value: 0.977\n( \n\n, and Kling and Liebman \n\n0.037 \n\n2000\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTable 5 reports these results. Column 4 reproduces the unadjusted results from \nTable 2. Columns 1 and 7 report lower and upper bounds under the worst-case sce-\nnario. We compute worst-case lower bounds by imputing missing values for each \nobservation in the treatment group as the minimum value observed in that group. For \nmissing observations in the control group, we use the maximum value observed in \nthe control group. In practice, because many of the outcomes are binary, this equates \nto assuming that all missing data for the treatment groups is zero and all missing \ndata for the control is one. Worst case upper bounds are computed analogously.\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nWe also consider alternative scenarios for missing observations. Column 2 con-\nstructs a lower bound by imputing missing values for the treatment group as the mean \nfor treatment group minus 0.25 standard deviations of the observed distribution for \nthe group. Missing values for the control group are imputed as the control group \nmean plus 0.25 standard deviations. Column 3 repeats this calculation for 0.10 stan-\ndard deviations. Upper bounds calculated using the same scenarios are reported in \ncolumns 5 and 6. Given the combined magnitude of attrition and business closure, \nthe  worst  case  bounds  are  large  and  uninformative.  The  range  tightens  consider-\nably when we employ plausible assumptions for the missing data. The results for \nbusiness  practices  are  the  most  robust,  maintaining  significance  at  the  10 percent \nlevel up to nearly a 0.50 standard deviation difference between the imputed values \nfor missing treatment and control observations. The effect on reporting errors also \nmaintains statistical significance for a relatively large band of assumptions regard-\ning missing data. Results for the revenue index, which were only marginally sig-\nnificant in the unadjusted results, are the most sensitive to assumptions regarding \nmissing observations.\n\nWe  then  consider  the  effect  of  the  follow-up  training,  with  the  aim  of  under-\nstanding the mechanisms though which training improves or fails to improve out-\ncomes.26 The results, available in Appendix Table A4, are not conclusive.

We consider this weak suggestive evidence \nthat our findings may be driven by simplicity per se rather than the standard account-\ning training\u2014because it covered more material\u2014requiring longer sessions or more \ncontact with an instructor.\n\nE. spillover Effects\n\n3\n\n4\n and \n(\n\nTable 6 provides suggestive evidence that some of the improvement in revenues \ngenerated by the treatments is due in part to crowding out competing businesses. It \nreports the results from estimating equations \n. As shown in columns 1 and \n(\n2, there is no evidence of learning spillovers from the training. Conditional on the \ndensity of businesses in one\u2019s neighborhood, the proximity of additional firms that \nwere randomly assigned to either training program does not have a demonstrable \neffect on the index of own business practices.

However, when we distinguish those neighboring businesses according \nto  their  industry,  a  clearer  pattern  emerges.

The results for sales in bad weeks, reported in column 6, follow the \nsame pattern, but none of the differences are significant. Overall these results pro-\nvide suggestive evidence that at least some of the improved sales due to financial \nliteracy training in this setting are due to crowd-out of other businesses.\n\nV.  Conclusion\n\nThe results from this study suggest that training to improve knowledge of finance \nand financial accounting indeed can have a positive effect on the management prac-\ntices of small businesses in an emerging market such as the Dominican Republic. \nHowever, we show that the impact of such training crucially depends on the form in \nwhich financial literacy training is provided. In this setting, a program that relies on \nthe standard approach to small business training, teaching the fundamentals of finan-\ncial accounting, had no measurable effect. But a training program based on simple \nrules of thumb led to significant improvements in the way businesses managed their \nfinances. Businesses in the rule-of-thumb training were more likely to implement \nthe material that was taught, keep accounting records, calculate monthly revenues, \nand separate their business and personal financial records. Moreover, these results \ntranslated into improvements in objective reporting quality and revenues.\n\nBeneath these average results, there is a clear pattern of heterogeneity. The rela-\ntive gains from the rule-of-thumb training were particularly large for firms starting at \nthe lower ends of the performance, ability or interest spectrums. This highlights the \nimportance of precisely evaluating the mechanisms through which training works \nor  does  not  work.  We  do  not  suggest  that  the  value  of  simplification  is  generic. \nRather, we show that one size does not fit all when it comes to training programs. It \nis important to match the training to the targeted client base.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate how rules of thumb can be applied effec-\ntively. We  believe  that  going  forward  it  will  be  important  to  understand  in  more \ndetail the potential costs and benefits of rule-of-thumb-based learning. For example, \nwould more advanced clients do better with more sophisticated training material? \nAre  there  situations  where  rule-of-thumb-based  training  could  make  it  more  dif-\nficult  for  businesses  to  adjust  to  new  circumstances  or  make  sense  of  unforeseen \ndevelopments?\n\nThese results come with two caveats. First, business performance is ultimately \nmeasured by profits not revenue. Not only are small business profits difficult to mea-\nsure, but as we demonstrate, training can affect reporting quality as well as actual \nprofits. Significant methodological improvements are necessary to generate reliable \nmeasures for this important outcome. Second, we find suggestive evidence that at \nleast some of the observed revenue increases come from crowding out sales by other \nfirms in the vicinity. More research is required before we can make conclusive state-\nments about the welfare effects of business training programs. Nevertheless, based \non these findings, it appears that in at least some contexts significant gains could be \nmade from simplifying training programs and relying more on easy-to-implement, \npractical rules of thumb.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f26 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nAppendix: Description of Training Programs\n\nTable A1\u2014 Summary of Training Programs\n\nClass 1\n\nClass 2\n\nClass 3\n\nClass 4\n\nClass 5\n\nRule of thumb\n\nSavings \n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002we\u2002should\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Set\u2002saving\u2002goals\n\u2022\u2002 Save\u2002for\u2002emergencies\n\u2022\u2002 Decide\u2002how\u2002to\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Compare\u2002saving\u2002services\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002savings\n\nConsumption\n\u2022\u2002 Financial\u2002burden\n\u2022\u2002 Study\u2002your\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002income\u2002&\u2002expenses\n\nDebt management\n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002borrowing\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002much\u2002debt\u2002I\u2002can\u2002afford\n\u2022\u2002 Default,\u2002what\u2002is\u2002it\u2002and\u2002how\u2002it\u2002happens\n\u2022\u2002 Cost\u2002of\u2002default\u2002and\u2002excessive\u2002debt\n\nAccount separation\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Why\u2002separate\u2002money\u2002for\u2002the\u2002household\u2002\n\nfrom money for the business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Separating\u2002household\u2002and\u2002business\u2002money\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Setting\u2002ourselves\u2002a\u2002salary\u2002\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002recognize\u2002and\u2002keep\u2002records\u2002of\u2002\nflows between business and household\n\nEstimation methods\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002total\u2002monthly\u2002flow\u2002of\u2002money\u2002\n\nbetween household and business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002increase/decrease\u2002of\u2002money\u2002in\u2002\nthe business between beginning and end \nof the month\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\n\nClass 6\n\nNone\n\nAccounting\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nBasic Accounting 1\n\u2022\u2002 Relevance\u2002of\u2002accounting\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002to\u2002record\u2002expenses\u2002and\u2002revenues\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002estimate\u2002and\u2002record\u2002daily\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\u2002using\u2002revenue\u2002and\u2002expense\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Understanding\u2002the\u2002difference\u2002between\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation and profits\n\nBasic Accounting 2\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Recording\u2002personal\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\u2002in\u2002\n\nbusiness accounts\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002nonoperational\u2002(personal)\u2002cash\u2002\n\noutflows and inflows.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Incorporating\u2002personal\u2002cashflows\u2002into\u2002profit\u2002\n\nestimation.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002include\u2002fixed\u2002costs\u2002into\u2002the\u2002profit\u2002\n\ncalculations\n\nBasic Accounting 3\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Aggregating\u2002daily\u2002records\u2002into\u2002monthly\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 Calculating\u2002monthly\u2002profit\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002payable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002receivable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n27\n\nTable A2\u2014Determinants of Attendance Conditional on Assignment to Treatment\n\nDependent variable\n\nFemale\n\nNumber of children\n\nHigh skillb\n\nAny savings\n\nInterested in accounting and financial training\n\nCurrent loan \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nLoan planned for fixed assets \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nRevenue indexc\n\nBusiness practices indexc\n\nBuy-sell businessd\n\nReports business improving\n\nConstant\n\nAttend any classa\n1\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.081\n0.063\n0.035***\n0.011\n0.104***\n0.040\n)\n0.011\n0.039\n0.074**\n0.036\n0.003\n0.011\n0.023**\n0.010\n)\n0.047*\n0.028\n0.045\n0.034\n)\n0.010\n0.037\n0.054**\n0.025\n0.197**\n0.083\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nAttend any classa\n2\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.062\n0.061\n0.032***\n0.011\n0.109***\n0.039\n)\n0.016\n0.038\n0.081**\n0.035\n0.000\n0.011\n0.024**\n0.010\n)\n0.050*\n0.028\n0.035\n0.033\n)\n0.020\n0.036\n0.051**\n0.024\n0.191**\n0.080\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\nObservations\nImpute values for missing data\n\n762 \nNo \n\n806\nYes\n\na  OLS regression of attending any class on the indicated set of variables, conditional on \nassignment to either treatment group. \nb  High skill indicates individuals with high school or greater formal education or previous \nfinancial trading.\nc  Indices are unweighted mean of z-scores of all component elements, scaled by control \ngroup mean and standard deviation, as detailed in Section IVC.

The  survey  team  utilized  various  forms  of  con-\ntact information from baseline and administrative data as well as credit officers in \nthe field in its efforts to locate all individuals in the study for the endline survey. \nUltimately, we collected endline data for 87 percent of participants reporting in the \nbaseline.17\n\nB. objective Reporting Measures\n\nSelf-reporting  bias  raises  concerns  about  any  measures  of  business  manage-\nment practices. Treated individuals may, for example, report maintaining separate \nbusiness and personal accounts because they were told this was important and not \nbecause they actually do so. To allay such concerns, we construct an objective index \nof financial reporting errors. We classify as an error any report of bad period sales \ngreater  than  average  or  good;  average  period  sales  better  than  good;  or  average \nperiod  profits better than good period sales for each of daily, weekly, and monthly \nreported outcomes. In the baseline, 45 percent of subjects make at least one mis-\ntake and 11 percent make three or more. Along the same lines, we compare self-\nreported profits to profits calculated from respondents\u2019 own revenue and expense \ndetail. These differences are large; self-reported profits are only 60 percent of those \ncalculated from the disaggregated components. While these differences could result \nfrom  misreporting  any  of  the  components,  we  believe  the  most  plausible  expla-\nnation  is  that  respondents  fail  to  remember  and,  hence,  underreport  their  various \ndetailed business expenses. This poses challenges when interpreting the impact of \neither treatment on profits. For example, training could increase actual profits while \nimproving recall of business expenses, leaving reported profits unchanged. For this \nreason, we are cautious when interpreting any profit measure as a stand-alone out-\ncome. To account for this possibility, we estimate the effect of each treatment on the \nraw and absolute difference between self-reported and calculated profits. Because \nwe  do  not  have  a  measure  of  true  profits,  we  cannot  make  statements  about  the \naccuracy of these measures; however, we expect that if either treatment improves \nfinancial controls, the difference between the two profit measures become smaller.\n\nC. Empirical strategy\n\nRandom assignment of the treatments allows us to obtain unbiased estimates of \nthe effect of being offered the training program by estimating the following equation:\n\n1\n\n(\n\n) \n\ny\n\nE \ny\n i \nX\n i \n  +   \u03b2 2  Ro T\n i \n  =  \u03b1  +   \u03b2 1  Acc t\n  i  \n  +  \u03b4  \n  +  \u03b3  \n\nB \n  +   \u03b5 i   ,\n  i  \n\nE   is  the  endline  value  of  the  outcome  variable  of  interest;  Acc t\n  i  \n\n i   is  an \nwhere   y\n i   is  an  indicator  for \n indicator  for  being  assigned  to  the  accounting  treatment;  Ro T\n i  is a matrix of baseline-measured \nbeing assigned to the rule-of-thumb treatment;  X\ncovariates  including  business  types,  loan  size,  and  participation  in  an ADOPEM \n\n17 Section IVD discusses attrition in more detail.\n\n \n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n13\n\n\u03b2\n\nB ,  explains \nsavings  account.

We restrict the sample to only those \nindividuals who report owning a business in the endline, so answers to all business \noutcome and performance measures \ne.g., weekly revenues or keeping business and \n(\n are well defined.18 Standard errors are clustered at the \npersonal accounts separate\nbarrio level to account for community-level shocks to business conditions.19\n\n, which allows interpretation of \n\n1\n(\n\n\u03b2\n\n)\n\n)\n\nWe test for heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to skill level, prior inter-\nest  in  training,  and  baseline  quartile  of  business  financial  practices  by  reestimat-\n,  while  restricting  the  sample  in  turn  to  each  of  the  partitioning \ning  equation \nsubgroups.20\n\n1\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n2011\n\nWhile we focus on a few key business practices and performance measures, we \nhave data on a range of distinct outcomes. Because testing multiple outcomes inde-\npendently increases the probability that we will reject the null of no effect for at \nleast  one  outcome,  we  follow  Kling,  Liebman,  and  Katz \n  and  Karlan  and \nValdivia \n in constructing index measures for three families of outcomes: busi-\n(\nness  practices,  personal  financial  practices,  and  business  revenues.21 Within  each \ncategory,  we  rescale  each  outcome,  such  that  larger  values  indicate  better  values \nfor  the  individual  or  business,  and  convert  each  measure  to  a  z-score,  such  that \n k  for \n \u2212  \u03bc k \n ki \ny\n ki \n z\n = ( \nthe  control  group.

These \nspillovers  can  take  two  forms.  First,  there  may  be  positive  knowledge  spillovers. \nTrained  clients  may  actively  pass  on  newly  acquired  knowledge  to  their  peers  or \nneighboring businesses may observe and mimic improved management practices. \nSecond,  business  outcomes  for  the  treated  may  improve  either  by  expanding  the \noverall  market,  \u201cgrowing  the  pie\u201d,  or  by  a  reallocation  of  revenues  from  control \nfirms to the treated, \u201cbusiness stealing\u201d. As described above, the businesses in this \nstudy tend to serve spatially local markets, therefore we follow a strategy similar to \n in testing for these externalities. Using address infor-\nMiguel and Kremer \nmation for each observation in the sample, we construct a measure of the distance \nbetween every pair of businesses.22 We then construct density measures for the total \n i , as well as the num-\nnumber of firms located within 0.5 kilometers of business i,  n\nn\n treatments.

The  estimated  effect  on  the  business  practices  index  is  0.07, \np-value: \napproximately  0.12  standard  deviations,  but  not  statistically  significant \n( \n0.198\n. Among the component elements, only the estimated effect on setting aside \n)\nfunds for business expenses is significant at the 10 percent level or better. Estimates \nfor the other business practice outcomes, while all positive, are not statistically sig-\nnificant and generally close to zero.\n\nIn  contrast,  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  reported  in  column  4,  substantially \nincreases the likelihood that individuals adopt better financial practices. Clients in \nthat treatment group report a higher likelihood of separating business and personal \ncash, keeping accounting records, separating business and personal accounts, set-\nting aside cash for business, and calculating revenues formally. Each of these mea-\nsures  increases  by  6 to 12  percentage  points  relative  to  the  control  group,  which \ndid not receive training, and all are significant at the 5 percent level or better. The \nrule-of-thumb  treatment  also  produces  a  significant  0.14  increase  in  the  business \npractices index, approximately 0.25 standard deviations. When looking at savings \nbehavior, we find a marginally significant impact of the rule-of-thumb training on \nthe likelihood of having any savings. The increase in total reported savings, while \nlarge, is not significant. Column 5 reports the p-values for tests of the equality of the \nstandard accounting and rule-of-thumb treatment effects. When considering the full \nsample, the rule-of-thumb training has a consistently more positive effect. The dif-\nferential impact on both separating business and personal cash and keeping account-\ning  records  are  significant  at  the  10  percent  level  or  better,  but  despite  the  rather \nlarge difference we cannot reject equality for the impact on the index of business \npractices.\n\n)\n\nThe second set of results shows the impact of training on measures of objective \nreporting  quality.  Fifty  percent  of  the  control  group  made  at  least  one  objective \nreporting error in their responses to survey questions regarding financial outcomes \n. Individuals in both treatment groups \nsee Section IIIB for a detailed description\n(\nare less likely to make any such mistakes. However, only for the rule-of-thumb train-\ning is the improvement significant, with treated individuals 8 percentage points less \nlikely to make any errors. Similarly, both treatments appear to reduce differences \nbetween directly reported profits and profits calculated from respondents\u2019 reported \nrevenues  and  expenses.

As  noted,  individuals \nassigned  to  the  rule-of-thumb  training  reported  lower  sales  in  these  periods  than \nthose assigned to the control group. These differences in baseline revenues are not \nsignificant at conventional levels; however, the treatment effect is insignificant when \ni.e., \nthe controls for baseline sales are dropped. Moreover, the quality of a period \ngood, average or bad\n was defined by the respondent, and our results are consistent \nwith both a change in how respondents classified periods and an improvement in \nactual revenues. With this caveat in mind, these results parallel those of Karlan and \nValdivia \n,  both  of  which  find \n)\nrevenue improvements in bad periods as a result of training. The findings remain \nconsistent with the possibility that effective training may operate by helping indi-\nviduals to better manage negative shocks or by alerting them to such shocks such \nthat they can counteract the effect of slow weeks.

There is no evidence that the rule-of-thumb training \ncauses any other changes in institutional outcomes.\n\nB. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects\n\nThe  efficacy  of  different  training  programs  is  likely  to  vary  through  the  popu-\nlation.  Table  4  reports  whether  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting  train-\nings  have  heterogeneous  treatment  effects  for  different  subgroups.  We  focus  on \nthree dimensions along which we expected training may have differential effects. \nFirst, we classify an individual as high-skilled if she has completed high school or \nreceived previous formal financial training and low-skilled otherwise. Differences \nin  treatment  effects  along  this  dimension  allow  us  to  test  whether  the  effective-\nness of training depends on initial levels of human capital. Second, we classify an \nindividual as interested in training if she indicated in the baseline survey a desire to \nreceive training in business accounting or financial management and not otherwise. \nDifferences along this dimension allow us to test whether the effectiveness of train-\ning depends on a participant\u2019s motivation. Third, we compare individuals across the \nquartiles of baseline business management practices.\n\nColumns 2 and 3 compare the impact of the trainings across different levels of \ninitial  human  capital.  The  first  row  in  each  panel  focuses  on  whether  the  clients \nadopted  better  business  practices. The  impacts  of  the  rule-of-thumb  treatment  on \n business  practices  appear  independent  of  skill  level;  both  subgroups  show  large \nand significant improvements. We then look at our different measures of objective \nreporting quality. Across both skill levels, we find that the rule-of-thumb treatment, \non average, reduced the likelihood that individuals made reporting errors, although \nthe results are only significant for low-skill individuals. Finally, we also test whether \nthere is a differential impact on business outcomes. The coefficients for the impact \non the revenue measures are positive for both groups, but none of the effects is sig-\nnificant when splitting the sample by skill level.24\n\nColumns 4 and 5 repeat the heterogeneous treatment analysis along the dimension \nof interest in training. Again, we find a positive effect on both groups, with similar \nand significant magnitudes. Objective reporting quality improves for both groups, \nwith  a  larger  effect for those expressing  greater interest in training. There are  no \nsignificant differences in the business performance measures across the groups.\n\nThis stands in contrast to the results of Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, which finds \n)\nthat less interested clients benefitted more from the training. We hypothesize that this  \n\n2011\n(\n\n24 The results for employment, not reported here but available from the authors, are interesting. The rule-of-\nthumb treatment reduces the number of employees for the low-skill group but increases employment in the busi-\nnesses  of  the  high-skilled  group.  Both  impacts  are  significant  and  significantly  different  from  one  another. We \nlack additional information with which to explore the precise mechanism at work here and therefore do not want \nto push the interpretation.

It suggests that in certain \ncircumstances the price mechanism may effectively allocate training programs.\n\nThe  last  three  columns  of  Table  4  show  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  had  a \nlarger impact on businesses with poorer management practices in the baseline.25 On \n\n25 Results for the second quartile of baseline business practices are suppressed due to space constraints.

The effects on objective reporting quality and busi-\nness performance are insufficiently precise to draw further conclusions. This might \nsuggest that the rule-of-thumb training allows the people with poor practices ex ante \nto catch up with the others. The ability of the rule-of-thumb training to benefit even \nthe most poorly managed businesses is primarily responsible for its larger average \ntreatment effect and supports the hypothesis that there may be advantages to reduc-\ning the complexity of training programs when targeting micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nThe second panel of Table 4 repeats the exact same set of regressions for the dif-\nferent subsamples for the standard accounting treatment group. There are several \npoints of note. First, the standard accounting treatment improves objective report-\ning quality, but only for high-skilled individuals. The accounting training actually \nincreases reporting errors for businesses in the lowest quartile of baseline business \npractices. Second, those who expressed greater interest in the training ex ante appear \nto change their business practices in response to the accounting training, while those \nwith  less  interest  are  unaffected. This  stands  in  contrast  to  the  pattern  of  hetero-\ngeneity  for  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  which  produced  comparable  and  in  some \ncases larger improvements for those who expressed less interest in training. Finally, \nlower-skilled clients in the accounting training report meaningful drops in their rev-\nenues. These effects are substantial, approximately 0.2 standard deviations from the \nbaseline reported values. Similarly, we find a significant reduction in sales for the \nquartile of clients with the worst business practices in the baseline.\n\nThese results are quite surprising and could be driven by several different chan-\nnels. On the one hand, there could be a negative causal effect of accounting training \non  less  educated  clients  if  they  spend  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  implement  standard \naccounting  techniques  without  much  success. Alternatively  one  could  conjecture \nthat trained clients are more realistic about their actual revenues while prior to the \ntraining they might have been overly optimistic. The relatively large effect on the \nraw difference in reported profits for this subgroup is consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that treated clients may be more aware of their true revenues but the observed \nincrease in reporting errors points in the other direction. Ultimately, we cannot rule \nout either channel.\n\nC. Differences between Rule-of-Thumb and standard Accounting Training\n\nWe  have  shown  above  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  stronger  positive \nimpact across several dimensions than the accounting training, especially on clients \nwith low education and worse business practices relative to the control group. We \nnow compare these two trainings directly to each other. The final panel of Table 4 \nreports the difference in the treatment effect between the rule-of-thumb and account-\ning trainings, and the p-values for testing the equality of treatment effects for all \nsubgroups. Looking across the subgroups, we find a very strong and consistent pat-\ntern according to individuals\u2019 interest in training \n. The rule-of-\n)\nthumb training had a substantially more positive impact than the accounting training \nfor clients that reported limited interest in training ex ante. There is a significantly \nlarger  effect  of  0.12  in  the  index  of  business  practices,  0.21  standard  deviations \n\ncolumns 4 and 5\n\n(\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n21\n\np-value: 0.055\n( \n\np-value: 0.052\n, and a 0.17 difference in the revenue index, 0.20 standard devia-\n)\n( \ntions \n. A similar pattern is observed in bad week sales, with results \nsignificant at approximately the 5 percent level. For those with a strong prior inter-\nest in training, the differences between the two trainings are not significant. On the \nwhole, the rule-of-thumb training generates substantially better outcomes for those \nwith a lower interest in training.\n\n)\n\nWhile not evident in the measures of business practices, we find similar outcomes \nalong the skill dimension in terms of objective reporting quality and business perfor-\nmance. Low-skilled individuals in the rule-of-thumb treatment were 12 percentage \npoints less likely to commit any reporting errors than those in the standard account-\n. This translates into differences in reported revenues, \ning training \np-value: \nwith a difference of 0.17 in the revenue index, 0.20 standard deviations \n( \n0.044\n\np-value: 0.016\n( \n\n)\n\nFinally, we look across quartiles of baseline business practices. In line with the \nfindings above, we see that the clients in the lowest quartile receiving the rule-of-\nthumb training see substantially larger and significant improvements in business and \nfinancial practices relative to those in the accounting training. Again, these results \ntranslate into substantially better sales outcomes. Within the middle quartiles there \nare no significant differences between the two trainings. Surprisingly, the difference \nin  business  practices  reemerges  in  the  top  quartile,  but  these  differences  are  not \nobserved in objective reporting quality or revenues.\n\n.\n)\n\nTaken  together  the  findings  suggest  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  sig-\nnificant and positive effect relative to the accounting training on clients that start \nfrom lower levels of skill, business practices, and interest in training. The same does \nnot  hold  for  higher  skilled,  better  managed  or  more  interested  businesses,  where \nthe impact of both trainings is similar. Not only is the rule-of-thumb training more \nlikely to improve business practices for clients at the lower end of the spectrum, it \nhas real effects on outcomes. This suggests that it is important to correctly match \nthe  characteristics  of  the  clients  with  the  type  of  training  that  will  be  useful  for \nthem.  Giving  an  unsophisticated  client  standard  accounting  training  can  actually \nreduce their performance, while the rule-of-thumb training substantially improves \ntheir outcomes.\n\nD. Robustness checks\n\nFirst, we discuss attrition. Our response rate was relatively high\u201487 percent of \nparticipants were reached for the endline\u2014but we find some evidence for selective \nattrition.  Treatment  group  individuals  who  were  not  reached  for  the  endline  sur-\nvey have generally higher baseline revenues \n than those who \ndropped  from  the  control  group \n.  Given  the  relatively  low \nrevenue  index \nlevel of attrition, this difference of 0.18 standard deviations is not statistically sig-\nnificant.  Nonetheless,  it  suggests  that  the  reported  results  for  business  outcomes \nmay understate the program\u2019s true effect. There are no differences across the two \ntreatment groups.\n\nrevenue index 0.05\n\n0.09\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\nIn addition to survey nonresponse, there is a relatively high incidence of business \nexit:  78  percent  of  individuals  reached  in  the  endline  report  operating  their  own \n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f22 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nbusiness relative to 97 percent in the baseline. As discussed above, qualitative evi-\ndence and discussions with ADOPEM suggest that a string of natural disasters led to \nan unusually high rate of out-migration from the Dominican Republic and business \nexit by the sample population. To test for differential attrition, we estimate a linear \nprobability model of business ownership in the endline on indicators for treatment \nstatus.  Coefficients  for  assignment  to  the  standard  accounting  and  rule-of-thumb \ntrainings are \n\n and 0.001 \nWe analyze the implications for our estimated treatment effects of different plau-\nsible assumptions for the potential outcomes of individuals who are not reached in \nthe endline or who report not having a business. We construct bounds on the treat-\nment effects for the rule-of-thumb training on the business practices index, revenue \nindex, and any reporting errors indicator using a range of assumptions for the pat-\ntern of attrition following an approach based on Horowitz and Manski \n, Lee \n2004\n2002\n\np-value: 0.235\n( \n\np-value: 0.977\n( \n\n, and Kling and Liebman \n\n0.037 \n\n2000\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTable 5 reports these results. Column 4 reproduces the unadjusted results from \nTable 2. Columns 1 and 7 report lower and upper bounds under the worst-case sce-\nnario. We compute worst-case lower bounds by imputing missing values for each \nobservation in the treatment group as the minimum value observed in that group. For \nmissing observations in the control group, we use the maximum value observed in \nthe control group. In practice, because many of the outcomes are binary, this equates \nto assuming that all missing data for the treatment groups is zero and all missing \ndata for the control is one. Worst case upper bounds are computed analogously.\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nWe also consider alternative scenarios for missing observations. Column 2 con-\nstructs a lower bound by imputing missing values for the treatment group as the mean \nfor treatment group minus 0.25 standard deviations of the observed distribution for \nthe group. Missing values for the control group are imputed as the control group \nmean plus 0.25 standard deviations. Column 3 repeats this calculation for 0.10 stan-\ndard deviations. Upper bounds calculated using the same scenarios are reported in \ncolumns 5 and 6. Given the combined magnitude of attrition and business closure, \nthe  worst  case  bounds  are  large  and  uninformative.  The  range  tightens  consider-\nably when we employ plausible assumptions for the missing data. The results for \nbusiness  practices  are  the  most  robust,  maintaining  significance  at  the  10 percent \nlevel up to nearly a 0.50 standard deviation difference between the imputed values \nfor missing treatment and control observations. The effect on reporting errors also \nmaintains statistical significance for a relatively large band of assumptions regard-\ning missing data. Results for the revenue index, which were only marginally sig-\nnificant in the unadjusted results, are the most sensitive to assumptions regarding \nmissing observations.\n\nWe  then  consider  the  effect  of  the  follow-up  training,  with  the  aim  of  under-\nstanding the mechanisms though which training improves or fails to improve out-\ncomes.26 The results, available in Appendix Table A4, are not conclusive.

We consider this weak suggestive evidence \nthat our findings may be driven by simplicity per se rather than the standard account-\ning training\u2014because it covered more material\u2014requiring longer sessions or more \ncontact with an instructor.\n\nE. spillover Effects\n\n3\n\n4\n and \n(\n\nTable 6 provides suggestive evidence that some of the improvement in revenues \ngenerated by the treatments is due in part to crowding out competing businesses. It \nreports the results from estimating equations \n. As shown in columns 1 and \n(\n2, there is no evidence of learning spillovers from the training. Conditional on the \ndensity of businesses in one\u2019s neighborhood, the proximity of additional firms that \nwere randomly assigned to either training program does not have a demonstrable \neffect on the index of own business practices.

The results for sales in bad weeks, reported in column 6, follow the \nsame pattern, but none of the differences are significant. Overall these results pro-\nvide suggestive evidence that at least some of the improved sales due to financial \nliteracy training in this setting are due to crowd-out of other businesses.\n\nV.  Conclusion\n\nThe results from this study suggest that training to improve knowledge of finance \nand financial accounting indeed can have a positive effect on the management prac-\ntices of small businesses in an emerging market such as the Dominican Republic. \nHowever, we show that the impact of such training crucially depends on the form in \nwhich financial literacy training is provided. In this setting, a program that relies on \nthe standard approach to small business training, teaching the fundamentals of finan-\ncial accounting, had no measurable effect. But a training program based on simple \nrules of thumb led to significant improvements in the way businesses managed their \nfinances. Businesses in the rule-of-thumb training were more likely to implement \nthe material that was taught, keep accounting records, calculate monthly revenues, \nand separate their business and personal financial records. Moreover, these results \ntranslated into improvements in objective reporting quality and revenues.\n\nBeneath these average results, there is a clear pattern of heterogeneity. The rela-\ntive gains from the rule-of-thumb training were particularly large for firms starting at \nthe lower ends of the performance, ability or interest spectrums. This highlights the \nimportance of precisely evaluating the mechanisms through which training works \nor  does  not  work.  We  do  not  suggest  that  the  value  of  simplification  is  generic. \nRather, we show that one size does not fit all when it comes to training programs. It \nis important to match the training to the targeted client base.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate how rules of thumb can be applied effec-\ntively. We  believe  that  going  forward  it  will  be  important  to  understand  in  more \ndetail the potential costs and benefits of rule-of-thumb-based learning. For example, \nwould more advanced clients do better with more sophisticated training material? \nAre  there  situations  where  rule-of-thumb-based  training  could  make  it  more  dif-\nficult  for  businesses  to  adjust  to  new  circumstances  or  make  sense  of  unforeseen \ndevelopments?\n\nThese results come with two caveats. First, business performance is ultimately \nmeasured by profits not revenue. Not only are small business profits difficult to mea-\nsure, but as we demonstrate, training can affect reporting quality as well as actual \nprofits. Significant methodological improvements are necessary to generate reliable \nmeasures for this important outcome. Second, we find suggestive evidence that at \nleast some of the observed revenue increases come from crowding out sales by other \nfirms in the vicinity. More research is required before we can make conclusive state-\nments about the welfare effects of business training programs. Nevertheless, based \non these findings, it appears that in at least some contexts significant gains could be \nmade from simplifying training programs and relying more on easy-to-implement, \npractical rules of thumb.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f26 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nAppendix: Description of Training Programs\n\nTable A1\u2014 Summary of Training Programs\n\nClass 1\n\nClass 2\n\nClass 3\n\nClass 4\n\nClass 5\n\nRule of thumb\n\nSavings \n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002we\u2002should\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Set\u2002saving\u2002goals\n\u2022\u2002 Save\u2002for\u2002emergencies\n\u2022\u2002 Decide\u2002how\u2002to\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Compare\u2002saving\u2002services\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002savings\n\nConsumption\n\u2022\u2002 Financial\u2002burden\n\u2022\u2002 Study\u2002your\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002income\u2002&\u2002expenses\n\nDebt management\n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002borrowing\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002much\u2002debt\u2002I\u2002can\u2002afford\n\u2022\u2002 Default,\u2002what\u2002is\u2002it\u2002and\u2002how\u2002it\u2002happens\n\u2022\u2002 Cost\u2002of\u2002default\u2002and\u2002excessive\u2002debt\n\nAccount separation\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Why\u2002separate\u2002money\u2002for\u2002the\u2002household\u2002\n\nfrom money for the business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Separating\u2002household\u2002and\u2002business\u2002money\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Setting\u2002ourselves\u2002a\u2002salary\u2002\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002recognize\u2002and\u2002keep\u2002records\u2002of\u2002\nflows between business and household\n\nEstimation methods\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002total\u2002monthly\u2002flow\u2002of\u2002money\u2002\n\nbetween household and business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002increase/decrease\u2002of\u2002money\u2002in\u2002\nthe business between beginning and end \nof the month\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\n\nClass 6\n\nNone\n\nAccounting\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nBasic Accounting 1\n\u2022\u2002 Relevance\u2002of\u2002accounting\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002to\u2002record\u2002expenses\u2002and\u2002revenues\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002estimate\u2002and\u2002record\u2002daily\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\u2002using\u2002revenue\u2002and\u2002expense\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Understanding\u2002the\u2002difference\u2002between\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation and profits\n\nBasic Accounting 2\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Recording\u2002personal\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\u2002in\u2002\n\nbusiness accounts\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002nonoperational\u2002(personal)\u2002cash\u2002\n\noutflows and inflows.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Incorporating\u2002personal\u2002cashflows\u2002into\u2002profit\u2002\n\nestimation.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002include\u2002fixed\u2002costs\u2002into\u2002the\u2002profit\u2002\n\ncalculations\n\nBasic Accounting 3\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Aggregating\u2002daily\u2002records\u2002into\u2002monthly\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 Calculating\u2002monthly\u2002profit\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002payable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002receivable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n27\n\nTable A2\u2014Determinants of Attendance Conditional on Assignment to Treatment\n\nDependent variable\n\nFemale\n\nNumber of children\n\nHigh skillb\n\nAny savings\n\nInterested in accounting and financial training\n\nCurrent loan \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nLoan planned for fixed assets \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nRevenue indexc\n\nBusiness practices indexc\n\nBuy-sell businessd\n\nReports business improving\n\nConstant\n\nAttend any classa\n1\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.081\n0.063\n0.035***\n0.011\n0.104***\n0.040\n)\n0.011\n0.039\n0.074**\n0.036\n0.003\n0.011\n0.023**\n0.010\n)\n0.047*\n0.028\n0.045\n0.034\n)\n0.010\n0.037\n0.054**\n0.025\n0.197**\n0.083\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nAttend any classa\n2\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.062\n0.061\n0.032***\n0.011\n0.109***\n0.039\n)\n0.016\n0.038\n0.081**\n0.035\n0.000\n0.011\n0.024**\n0.010\n)\n0.050*\n0.028\n0.035\n0.033\n)\n0.020\n0.036\n0.051**\n0.024\n0.191**\n0.080\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\nObservations\nImpute values for missing data\n\n762 \nNo \n\n806\nYes\n\na  OLS regression of attending any class on the indicated set of variables, conditional on \nassignment to either treatment group. \nb  High skill indicates individuals with high school or greater formal education or previous \nfinancial trading.\nc  Indices are unweighted mean of z-scores of all component elements, scaled by control \ngroup mean and standard deviation, as detailed in Section IVC.

We  conducted  a  randomized \nevaluation  with  a  bank  in  the  Dominican  Republic  to  compare  the \nimpact  of  two  distinct  programs:  standard  accounting  training \nversus a simplified, rule-of-thumb training that taught basic financial \nheuristics.  The  rule-of-thumb \nimproved \nfirms\u2019  financial  practices,  objective  reporting  quality,  and  revenues. \nFor  micro-entrepreneurs  with  lower  skills  or  poor  initial  financial \npractices,  the  impact  of  the  rule-of-thumb  training  was  significantly \nlarger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that \nsimplifying  training  programs  might  improve  their  effectiveness  for \nless  sophisticated  individuals. \nJEL  D4,  G21,  J24,  L25,  L26,  M41, \n(\nO16\n\ntraining  significantly \n\n)\n\nIndividuals  and  micro-entrepreneurs  alike  are  asked  to  make  complex  financial \n\ndecisions in many areas of life, whether in their personal finances in the form of \nsavings decisions and retirement planning or in a business context as small business \nowners or investors.

The evidence so far has been mixed, with large \nheterogeneity in the estimated success of training programs. For example, Bernheim \nand  Garrett \n  provide  survey  evidence  that  people  who \nattend financial counseling programs subsequently make better financial decisions, \nespecially  those  attendees  with  low  income  and  education  levels.  The  estimated \neffects of the programs are large; however, self-selection into training could lead to \nan upward bias. In contrast, Duflo and Saez \n conduct a randomized evaluation \n(\nexposing  employees  to  a  benefits  fair  that  raises  awareness  about  retirement  sav-\nings, but they find only a small effect on savings plan enrollment. Similarly, Cole, \nSampson, and Zia \n find only modest effects from a financial literacy training \nprogram in Indonesia.\n\n2003\n\n2011\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nOne major challenge in studying the impact of such financial literacy programs is \nthat measured impacts conflate the usefulness of the financial skills with the effec-\ntiveness  of  the  specific  training  methodology  used  in  the  study. To  date  we  have \nonly  very  limited  systematic  knowledge  about  the  dimensions  that  determine  the \nimpact of a financial literacy program. This impact might be crucially affected by \nthe comprehensiveness and complexity of the materials, and all training programs \nface a trade-off between the ease with which participants can grasp the concepts and \ntheir potential depth of understanding.\n\n)\n\n2007a\n\nTo advance our knowledge of how differences in the structure and complexity of \ntraining programs affect participants\u2019 performance, we worked with a bank in the \nDominican Republic to conduct a randomized evaluation comparing the impact of \ntwo financial literacy training programs for small business owners. While we do not \nfocus specifically on consumer financial literacy of the sort studied by Lusardi and \nMitchell \n and others, we note that for microenterprises the boundary between \n(\nbusiness  and  personal  financial  decisions  is  often  blurred.  In  order  to  understand \nthe channel through which financial training may affect recipients, we worked with \nADOPEM, a microfinance institution in the Dominican Republic with a long history \nof offering training to its clients, to develop two distinct types of training that span \nthe spectrum between comprehensiveness of the material and ease of understand-\ning. Our aim in designing and evaluating these two programs is to assess whether \nthere may be advantages to reducing the complexity of training programs and, in \nparticular, if the simpler rule-of-thumb training is a better fit for less-educated or \nless financially sophisticated clients.\n\nThe standard accounting program closely follows a standard approach to small \nbusiness  training,  which  is  designed  to  teach  micro-entrepreneurs  the  basics  of \ndouble-entry accounting, working capital management, and investment decisions. \nSimilar programs are used around the world by groups such as Freedom from Hunger, \nthe International Labor Organization, BRAC, and many others.1 The rule-of-thumb \ntraining focuses on very simple heuristics or routines for financial decision  making \n\n1 The traditional accounting training was based on the then-current curricula of Freedom from Hunger and the \nILO\u2019s Start and Improve Your Business program. Working with the training center at ADOPEM, we adapted these \nprograms to the Dominican context in terms of language, idiom, and the specific examples used in teaching.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n3\n\nwithout aiming to provide comprehensive accounting knowledge. For example, the \nstandard accounting trainings taught participants to separate their business and per-\nsonal  accounts  by  instructing  them  how  to  calculate  business  profits  based  on  a \ntypical accounting curriculum for micro-entrepreneurs. The rule-of-thumb training \ngave them a physical rule to keep their money in two separate drawers \n)\nand  to  only  transfer  money  from  one  drawer  to  the  other  with  an  explicit  \u201cIOU\u201d \nnote between the business and the household. At the end of the month they could \nthen count how much money was in the business drawer and know what their profits \nwere.\n\nor purses\n(\n\nBetween November 2006 and July 2008, we implemented a randomized evalu-\nation of these two training programs in collaboration with ADOPEM. We selected \n1,193 of their existing clients who had expressed some interest in training and ran-\ndomly  assigned  them  either  to  one  of  the  two  trainings  or  a  control  group.  Our \nresults document important differences in the impact of the two approaches. People \nwho were offered rule-of-thumb-based training showed significant improvements in \nthe way they managed their finances and in the accuracy and internal consistency \nof the numbers they reported. They were more likely to keep accounting records, \ncalculate monthly revenues, and separate their books for the business and the home. \nImprovements along these dimensions are on the order of 10 percentage points. In \ncontrast, we did not find any significant changes for those in the standard accounting \ntraining. We note that while only the rule-of-thumb training generated significant \nimprovements in business practices and reporting quality, the differences between \nthe two treatments in the full sample were not statistically significant. However, for \nthe subset of clients that are lower skilled or had poorer financial practices in the \nbaseline, we show that the rule-of-thumb training had a larger and significantly more \npositive impact than the standard accounting training. Overall, it appears that the \nmicro-entrepreneurs in our study were more likely to implement what they learned \nin the rule-of-thumb training.\n\nIn  studying  training  programs,  measurement  effects  are  a  natural  concern. \nRespondents  may  report  what  they  believe  surveyors  want  to  hear.  Therefore, \nwe  developed  and  looked  for  changes  in  objective  measures  of  reporting  quality. \nConsistent  with  the  belief  that  SMEs  lack  financial  controls,  the  quality  of  self-\nreported  firm  data  is  poor.  In  the  baseline  survey,  nearly  half  of  the  respondents \nmake at least one error when asked to report sales and profits over different time \nhorizons and levels of aggregation. Similarly, self-reported profits are, on average, \nsubstantially lower than what one would calculate from respondents\u2019 own revenue \nand expense detail.2 The standard accounting training generates small and not statis-\ntically significant improvements in both dimensions. In contrast, the rule-of-thumb \ntraining  significantly  improves  objective  reporting  quality. The  error  rate  falls  by \n9 percentage points, and the mean difference between the two profit measures drops \n\n)\n\n2 The direction of this reporting bias goes in the opposite direction from what De Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff \n found in their sample of small firms in Sri Lanka, for which self-reported profits are larger than those calcu-\n2009\n(\nlated from revenue and expense detail. We speculate that the firms in our sample have less incentive to underreport \nrevenues but have poor recall over expense detail and fail to record the necessary information. Note also that there \nis substantial variation in these errors. In the control group, directly reported profits are less than calculated profits \nfor 58 percent of the sample and larger for 28 percent.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f4 \n\nAmericAn economic JournAl: Applied economics \n\nApril 2014\n\nby more than 50 percent. These improvements in objective reporting quality suggest \nthat the rule-of-thumb training changes actual business management practices. They \nalso underscore a key challenge in using profits as an outcome measure in business \ntraining studies. Not only are profits difficult to measure\u2014this is well understood\u2014\nbut estimated effects often conflate the effect of the treatment on actual profits with \nchanges in reporting quality.\n\nWhen looking at the impact of training on business outcomes, we again find a \nmore significant change in the group that received the rule-of-thumb training. We \nfind a statistically significant and economically meaningful impact of 0.11 standard \ndeviations on an index of revenue measures. The most significant effect is observed \nin the level of sales during self-reported bad weeks. While these results should be \ninterpreted with caution\u2014the training may have affected revenue reporting as well \nas actual revenues\u2014we note that this is consistent with an emerging pattern in other \n. \nrecent studies \n)\nThe  standard  accounting  training  produces  no  significant  effects. The  differences \nbetween the two trainings is large and statistically significant.\n\nKarlan and Valdivia 2011; Berge, Bjorvatn, and Tungodden 2012\n\n(\n\nIn  a  second  step,  we  test  for  heterogeneous  treatment  effects,  comparing  the \nrelative  effect  of  the  trainings  across  clients  with  different  characteristics.  The \n rule-of-thumb  training  produces  a  more  pronounced  effect  for  less  sophisticated \nclients: those with the lowest human capital, limited ex ante interest in accounting \nor financial training, or with baseline business practices in the lowest quartile.3 For \nthese  clients,  the  differences  between  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting \ntrainings are economically and statistically significant. These findings highlight the \nimportance of heterogeneity and targeting training materials to client characteris-\ntics. A simplified rule-of-thumb training appears well suited to the needs of the less \nsophisticated clients.4\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that effective training may operate by help-\ning  individuals  to  better  manage  negative  shocks  or  by  improving  their  financial \ncontrols, which may allow them to predict and counteract the effect of slow weeks \nmore proactively. However, it is important to note that improvements for firms in the \nrule-of-thumb treatment could stem from net business growth or from a redistribu-\ntion from other enterprises in their area. Our study design allows us to test for these \nnegative spillovers. We find a small but statistically significant drop in sales for firms \nlocated near more treated firms if these treated firms are in the same general line of \nbusiness. These results are suggestive that some of the growth in the treated firms \n\n3 The original sample frame of 1,193 individuals comprised borrowers who expressed interest in generic busi-\nness training before the start of the program. In the baseline survey, respondents were asked to indicate their interest \nin specific forms of training. We classify an individual as \u201cinterested in training\u201d if she indicated a desire to receive \ntraining in business accounting or financial management.\n\n4 Simplicity could benefit trainees in two ways, either by making concepts more accessible or by allowing more \ntime for repetition of each topic. This difference is conceptually important; however with a fixed time budget, the \ntwo are jointly determined. To disentangle these mechanisms, we aimed to keep the teaching time of each topic \nsimilar across the two training programs. The rule-of-thumb training was implemented in a total of five training \nsessions versus six for the standard accounting program. Furthermore, we implemented an additional treatment arm \nthat provided focused, hands-on repetition of all the concepts to a subset of both primary treatment groups. The \nresults, reported in Appendix Table A4, show no significant improvements from relaxing the time constraint. This \nsuggests that in this context simplicity per se and not repetition is driving the results.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n5\n\nwas due to crowding out of other firms and identify an important avenue for future \nwork.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Related Literature and Background\n\nA  growing  literature  has  documented  the  low  level  of  financial  literacy  in  the \n\ngeneral  population  and  its  impact  on  individual  decision  making.

In contrast, this study explicitly tests the impact of different types \nof financial literacy training\u2014standard accounting and a simplified, rule-of-thumb \napproach\u2014with the aim of beginning to understand the mechanisms through which \ntraining programs may or may not work.6\n\n5 Meier and Sprenger \n\n, for example, document that individuals who choose to acquire personal finan-\n)\ncial information through a credit counseling program discount the future less than individuals who choose not to \nparticipate.\n\n2008\n\n(\n\n6 A number of papers in the education literature demonstrate that both choosing the appropriate level of cur-\nriculum and targeting concrete tasks rather than broad improvement are important for learning outcomes.

Their study focuses on constraints to women\u2019s entrepreneurial \nchoices, with particular attention on encouraging savings and improving debt man-\nagement, and finds that being invited to the training program increased both bor-\nrowing and the likelihood of personal labor income. A recent program evaluation by \nBerge, Bjorvatn, and Tungodden \n evaluates the effect of financial grants and \na wide-ranging business training program for clients of a microfinance institution in \nTanzania. They find little effect on female clients, but a substantial impact on men\u2019s \nbusiness practices and outcomes. Bruhn and Zia \n study a training program for \n(\nyoung entrepreneurs in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina, finding that while the \nprogram did not affect business survival, it significantly improved business practices \nfor surviving businesses. Similar to our study, they find some evidence of hetero-\ngeneous responses. The training program appears to improve business performance \nonly for those individuals who were more skilled before the program began.\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n2013\n)\n\nA related strand in the literature on capacity building for small- and  medium-size \nenterprises  focuses  on  providing  consulting  and  management  services  to  firms. \nBloom  et  al. \n  study  the  impact  of  intensive  consulting  services  from  an \ninternational management consulting firm on the business practices of medium- to \n large-size firms in the Indian textile industry. Even these large firms were unaware \nof many modern management practices, and treated plants significantly improved \ntheir management practices. Bruhn, Karlan, and Schoar \n conduct a random-\n)\nized evaluation of consulting services in which small businesses were paired with a \nlocal management consultant for one year. The study assigned firms to a wide range \nof management consulting services, with financial literacy as an integral part of the \nintervention. More than 30 percent of the firms requested financial advice as one of \nthe main inputs.\n\n2010\n(\n\nSBA\n\n7 For  example,  the  US  Small  Business Administration\u2019s \n\n  small  business  training  network,  the  World \nBank\u2019s  SME  Toolkit,  the  International  Labour  Organization\u2019s  Know About  Business  Programme,  the  Financial \nEducation for the Poor \n project sponsored by Microfinance Opportunities, the Citigroup Foundation, Freedom \nFEP\n(\nfrom Hunger, and many others aim to teach financial skills at a huge expense every year.

Experimental Design\n\nADOPEM  is  a  savings  and  credit  bank  based  in  Santo  Domingo,  Dominican \nRepublic  serving  primarily  low-income,  urban  individuals  and  small  businesses \nthroughout  the  country.  ADOPEM  was  founded  in  1982  as  a  nongovernmental \norganization  providing  a  range  of  programs  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  levels  in \nthe Dominican Republic. Since then, they have increased their focus on financial \nservices and related activities, incorporating as a bank in 2004. Large by Dominican \nstandards,  in  2006  ADOPEM  had  approximately  59,000  clients  in  19  branches. \nThe  bank  offers  a  wide  range  of  lending  products.  In  2006,  90  percent  of  loans \nwere for amounts between RD$2,500 and RD$50,000 \n. Over that \nsame period, 56 percent of loans were made to individual persons or businesses and \n44 percent were made to solidarity groups of two to five borrowers.9 Approximately \n80 percent of these clients were women.\n\nUS$70\u2013$1,400\n\n)\n\n(\n\nIn addition to extending loans, ADOPEM offers savings, insurance, and remit-\ntance  products.  It  also  operates  a  training  center,  with  programs  including  basic \ncomputing, entrepreneurship, and specific trade skills. In the year before this experi-\nment was launched, ADOPEM was actively planning to launch a dedicated financial \neducation program and was interested in evaluating different approaches.\n\nWe worked with ADOPEM and Dominican training experts to develop two alter-\nnative  financial  education  training  programs.  The  standard  accounting  treatment \noffered a traditional, principles-based course in basic accounting techniques. Topics \ncovered  included  daily  recordkeeping  of  cash  sales  and  expenses,  aggregation  of \ndaily records into monthly reports, inventory management, accounts receivable and \naccounts payable, calculating cash profits, and investment planning. The materials \n\n9 ADOPEM\u2019s solidarity groups follow the traditional joint liability model. Each borrower takes out his or her \nloan as an individual, but all group members are jointly responsible for one another\u2019s repayment. Should any mem-\nber fail to repay, each member suffers the default consequences as if she herself failed to repay.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f8 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nand capacitator training program for the standard accounting treatment were based \non the financial education program designed by Freedom from Hunger, a US-based \nnonprofit organization, together with the Citigroup Foundation and adapted to local \nconditions.10\n\n)\n\nThe rule-of-thumb treatment taught participants simple rules for financial deci-\nsion  making,  focusing  on  the  need  to  separate  business  and  personal  accounts. \nAccount separation is a staple rule in developed country entrepreneurship. In devel-\noping countries, where the tax and legal motivations for account separation often \nare weaker, it continues to receive a great deal of attention. The proposed benefits \nof account separation are twofold. On the one hand, it is seen as a very crude but \neasy way to monitor whether the business is self-sustainable and provides an esti-\nmate of the profitability of the business. The second rationale is more behavioral: \nkeeping accounts separate serves as a commitment device for the business owner \n not to overconsume and deplete the working capital in the business. In \nor relatives\n(\naddition to presenting several strategies for physically separating business and per-\nsonal funds, the rule-of-thumb treatment taught how to estimate business profits by \nsimple changes in business cash on hand, paying oneself a fixed salary, distinguish-\ning  business  and  personal  expenses,  and  easy-to-implement  tools  for  reconciling \naccounts when business funds have been used for personal expenses or the reverse. \nIn both treatments, clients received record-keeping books, handouts, and homework \nassignments to reinforce ideas or techniques from the meetings. Both classes were \noffered once a week for three hours at a time. The standard accounting treatment \nlasted for six weeks and the rule-of-thumb treatment for five. The first three classes \nof both treatments covered consumption, savings, and debt management. The final \nthree classes of the standard accounting treatment comprised basic cash account-\ning, distinguishing business and personal expenses, calculating profits, and working \ncapital management. Classes four and five of the rule-of-thumb treatment focused \non separating business and personal money and estimation techniques for calculat-\ning profits.11 Attendance for classes one through five did not differ across the two \ntreatments.\n\nThe  sample  consisted  of  1,193  existing  ADOPEM  business  or  personal  loan \n clients from Santo Domingo.12 Of these, we assigned 402 to the accounting treat-\nment, 404 to the rule-of-thumb treatment, and 387 to a control group that received \nno additional training services. The treatment was assigned at the individual level \nand administrative data was used to stratify according to loan size, years of borrow-\ning, and whether or not a client maintained a formal savings account with the bank. \nBaseline survey data was not available at the time of the stratification. ADOPEM \n\n10 The ADOPEM training program is most closely related to the budgeting module of the FFH training program. \nThis module includes training on: how to develop a financial plan for the household expenses, how to adapt the \nspending to a restricted income, how to develop a budget for the house and the business, how to prioritize spending, \nhow to record income and expenses, how to use income and expenses bookkeeping to make financial decisions, and \nhow to store financial documents. Importantly, both ADOPEM training programs focused on maintaining a clear \nseparation of business accounts.\n\n11 See Table A1 for a more detailed summary of the materials covered.\n12 At the request of ADOPEM, group loan clients with loans smaller than RD$15,000 were excluded from the \nstudy. The original sample comprised 1,200 individuals; however, 7 observations were discarded due to errors in \nthe baseline survey.\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n9\n\nmade no additional policy changes concurrent with the training program. The treat-\nment was conducted in two waves. The first wave, comprising 302 treatment assign-\nments, was conducted from March to May 2007, and the second wave, comprising \nthe remainder, ran from July to August of the same year.13\n\nAll courses were taught by qualified local instructors. The majority had university \ndegrees and experience with adult education, in most cases with ADOPEM directly. \nCourses were offered at seven schools throughout Santo Domingo and scheduled \nbased on preferences elicited during the baseline survey. In addition, the course was \nheavily subsidized. Fees were randomly assigned at RD$200 \n(\nor zero, relative to an overall program cost of approximately RD$700.14\n\napproximately US$6\n\n)\n\nIn  order  to  begin  understanding  the  potential  limitations  to  classroom-based, \nfinancial training, we also randomly assigned half of the people in each of the treat-\nment groups to receive follow-up training consisting of in-person visits of a financial \ntrainer to the micro-entrepreneur\u2019s business. When necessary, the trainers reviewed \nthe  class  materials  with  the  entrepreneurs,  helped  clarify  any  questions  they  had, \nand reviewed their account records, if any. The purpose of the on-site visits was to \nensure that individuals understood the material and were capable of implementing \ntheir newly-acquired financial accounting skills in their businesses. This structure \nhelps us to differentiate the channel by which training affects the participants. If we \ndo not find an effect of training we can determine whether this result is due to the \ninability of the participants to understand what was taught in class or whether the \nmaterial itself, even when properly understood, is not helpful.\n\nIII.  Data and Empirical Strategy\n\nWe constructed the original sample frame based on administrative data collected \nby ADOPEM in the ordinary course of operations. Beginning in November 2006, \nwe conducted a baseline survey of each study participant using a professional sur-\nvey firm unaffiliated with ADOPEM. We collected information on household and \nbusiness characteristics, business practices and performance, business skills, train-\ning history, and interest in future training. The endline survey was conducted during \nthe summer of 2008, at least 12 months after training was completed. We augmented \nthe surveys with administrative data from ADOPEM.\n\nA. Descriptive statistics\n\nTable  1  reports  summary  statistics  for  the  full  sample  and  each  of  the  three \nassignment  groups  from  the  baseline  data.  Given  that  the  treatments  were  ran-\ndomly assigned, we expect individuals in the three assignment groups to be similar \n\n13 A third wave of 800 individuals across all three assignment categories was planned for late 2007, but was \n\ncancelled due to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Dean and Noel and Tropical Storm Olga.\n\n14 The original design was intended to test for selection effects. As noted in Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, the \nemerging approach to business development services calls for pricing training services at or above marginal costs. \nHowever, if those entrepreneurs who would most benefit are uncertain of the program\u2019s benefits or subject to tighter \ncredit constraints, this approach may induce adverse selection. Unfortunately, due to logistical issues associated \nwith data gathering we are unable to analyze the selection results along this dimension.\n\n2011\n\n(\n\n)\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple \n\f10 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nTable 1\u2014Baseline Summary Statisticsa\n\nFull \nsample\n mean\n2\n\n(\n\n)\n\nStandard \naccounting \ntreatment\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\nControl\n3\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom\ncontrol\n5\n\n(\n\n)\n\nRule-of-\nthumb \ntreatment\n6\n\n(\n\n)\n\nDifference \nfrom \ncontrol\n7\n\n(\n\n)\n\nObservations\n1\n\n(\npanel A.

Treated individuals may, for example, report maintaining separate \nbusiness and personal accounts because they were told this was important and not \nbecause they actually do so. To allay such concerns, we construct an objective index \nof financial reporting errors. We classify as an error any report of bad period sales \ngreater  than  average  or  good;  average  period  sales  better  than  good;  or  average \nperiod  profits better than good period sales for each of daily, weekly, and monthly \nreported outcomes. In the baseline, 45 percent of subjects make at least one mis-\ntake and 11 percent make three or more. Along the same lines, we compare self-\nreported profits to profits calculated from respondents\u2019 own revenue and expense \ndetail. These differences are large; self-reported profits are only 60 percent of those \ncalculated from the disaggregated components. While these differences could result \nfrom  misreporting  any  of  the  components,  we  believe  the  most  plausible  expla-\nnation  is  that  respondents  fail  to  remember  and,  hence,  underreport  their  various \ndetailed business expenses. This poses challenges when interpreting the impact of \neither treatment on profits. For example, training could increase actual profits while \nimproving recall of business expenses, leaving reported profits unchanged. For this \nreason, we are cautious when interpreting any profit measure as a stand-alone out-\ncome. To account for this possibility, we estimate the effect of each treatment on the \nraw and absolute difference between self-reported and calculated profits. Because \nwe  do  not  have  a  measure  of  true  profits,  we  cannot  make  statements  about  the \naccuracy of these measures; however, we expect that if either treatment improves \nfinancial controls, the difference between the two profit measures become smaller.\n\nC. Empirical strategy\n\nRandom assignment of the treatments allows us to obtain unbiased estimates of \nthe effect of being offered the training program by estimating the following equation:\n\n1\n\n(\n\n) \n\ny\n\nE \ny\n i \nX\n i \n  +   \u03b2 2  Ro T\n i \n  =  \u03b1  +   \u03b2 1  Acc t\n  i  \n  +  \u03b4  \n  +  \u03b3  \n\nB \n  +   \u03b5 i   ,\n  i  \n\nE   is  the  endline  value  of  the  outcome  variable  of  interest;  Acc t\n  i  \n\n i   is  an \nwhere   y\n i   is  an  indicator  for \n indicator  for  being  assigned  to  the  accounting  treatment;  Ro T\n i  is a matrix of baseline-measured \nbeing assigned to the rule-of-thumb treatment;  X\ncovariates  including  business  types,  loan  size,  and  participation  in  an ADOPEM \n\n17 Section IVD discusses attrition in more detail.\n\n \n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n13\n\n\u03b2\n\nB ,  explains \nsavings  account.

These \nspillovers  can  take  two  forms.  First,  there  may  be  positive  knowledge  spillovers. \nTrained  clients  may  actively  pass  on  newly  acquired  knowledge  to  their  peers  or \nneighboring businesses may observe and mimic improved management practices. \nSecond,  business  outcomes  for  the  treated  may  improve  either  by  expanding  the \noverall  market,  \u201cgrowing  the  pie\u201d,  or  by  a  reallocation  of  revenues  from  control \nfirms to the treated, \u201cbusiness stealing\u201d. As described above, the businesses in this \nstudy tend to serve spatially local markets, therefore we follow a strategy similar to \n in testing for these externalities.

Among the component elements, only the estimated effect on setting aside \n)\nfunds for business expenses is significant at the 10 percent level or better. Estimates \nfor the other business practice outcomes, while all positive, are not statistically sig-\nnificant and generally close to zero.\n\nIn  contrast,  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  reported  in  column  4,  substantially \nincreases the likelihood that individuals adopt better financial practices. Clients in \nthat treatment group report a higher likelihood of separating business and personal \ncash, keeping accounting records, separating business and personal accounts, set-\nting aside cash for business, and calculating revenues formally. Each of these mea-\nsures  increases  by  6 to 12  percentage  points  relative  to  the  control  group,  which \ndid not receive training, and all are significant at the 5 percent level or better. The \nrule-of-thumb  treatment  also  produces  a  significant  0.14  increase  in  the  business \npractices index, approximately 0.25 standard deviations. When looking at savings \nbehavior, we find a marginally significant impact of the rule-of-thumb training on \nthe likelihood of having any savings. The increase in total reported savings, while \nlarge, is not significant. Column 5 reports the p-values for tests of the equality of the \nstandard accounting and rule-of-thumb treatment effects. When considering the full \nsample, the rule-of-thumb training has a consistently more positive effect. The dif-\nferential impact on both separating business and personal cash and keeping account-\ning  records  are  significant  at  the  10  percent  level  or  better,  but  despite  the  rather \nlarge difference we cannot reject equality for the impact on the index of business \npractices.\n\n)\n\nThe second set of results shows the impact of training on measures of objective \nreporting  quality.

Heterogeneous Treatment Effects\n\nThe  efficacy  of  different  training  programs  is  likely  to  vary  through  the  popu-\nlation.  Table  4  reports  whether  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting  train-\nings  have  heterogeneous  treatment  effects  for  different  subgroups.  We  focus  on \nthree dimensions along which we expected training may have differential effects. \nFirst, we classify an individual as high-skilled if she has completed high school or \nreceived previous formal financial training and low-skilled otherwise. Differences \nin  treatment  effects  along  this  dimension  allow  us  to  test  whether  the  effective-\nness of training depends on initial levels of human capital. Second, we classify an \nindividual as interested in training if she indicated in the baseline survey a desire to \nreceive training in business accounting or financial management and not otherwise. \nDifferences along this dimension allow us to test whether the effectiveness of train-\ning depends on a participant\u2019s motivation. Third, we compare individuals across the \nquartiles of baseline business management practices.\n\nColumns 2 and 3 compare the impact of the trainings across different levels of \ninitial  human  capital.  The  first  row  in  each  panel  focuses  on  whether  the  clients \nadopted  better  business  practices. The  impacts  of  the  rule-of-thumb  treatment  on \n business  practices  appear  independent  of  skill  level;  both  subgroups  show  large \nand significant improvements. We then look at our different measures of objective \nreporting quality. Across both skill levels, we find that the rule-of-thumb treatment, \non average, reduced the likelihood that individuals made reporting errors, although \nthe results are only significant for low-skill individuals. Finally, we also test whether \nthere is a differential impact on business outcomes. The coefficients for the impact \non the revenue measures are positive for both groups, but none of the effects is sig-\nnificant when splitting the sample by skill level.24\n\nColumns 4 and 5 repeat the heterogeneous treatment analysis along the dimension \nof interest in training. Again, we find a positive effect on both groups, with similar \nand significant magnitudes. Objective reporting quality improves for both groups, \nwith  a  larger  effect for those expressing  greater interest in training. There are  no \nsignificant differences in the business performance measures across the groups.\n\nThis stands in contrast to the results of Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, which finds \n)\nthat less interested clients benefitted more from the training. We hypothesize that this  \n\n2011\n(\n\n24 The results for employment, not reported here but available from the authors, are interesting. The rule-of-\nthumb treatment reduces the number of employees for the low-skill group but increases employment in the busi-\nnesses  of  the  high-skilled  group.  Both  impacts  are  significant  and  significantly  different  from  one  another. We \nlack additional information with which to explore the precise mechanism at work here and therefore do not want \nto push the interpretation. However, in light of Karlan and Zinman\u2019s \n finding that small business owners in \nthe Philippines shed paid employees after receiving a microcredit loan, the results suggest it would be valuable to \nfurther study the determinants of labor demand by small businesses.\n\n2011\n\n)\n\n(\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n19\n\nTable 4\u2014Impact of Training, by Subgroupa\n\nSkill levelb\n\nPrior interest in training Baseline business prac \n\n(\n\nAll\n1\n\n(\n\n)\n\nLow\n2\n\n(\n\n)\n\nHigh\n3\n\n(\n\n)\n\nNo\n4\n\n(\n\n)\n\nYes\n5\n\n(\n\n)\n\nFirst\n6\n\n(\n\n)\n\nThird\n7\n\n(\n\n)\n\nf\n\nby quartile\n\n)\nFourth\n8\n\n(\n\n)\n\nRule-of-thumb training\nBusiness practices indexc\n\nAny reporting errorsd\n\nRevenue indexc\n\nSales, bad week \n\nRD$\n\n(\n\ne\n)\n\n0.14***\n0.04\n\n(\n\n)\n0.08**\n0.03\n\n\u2212\n(\n)\n0.09* \n0.05\n\n(\n\n)\n967* \n523\n\n)\n\n(\n\nstandard accounting training\nBusiness practices indexc\n\nAny reporting errorsd\n\nRevenue indexc\n\nSales, bad week \n\nRD$\n\n(\n\ne\n)\n\n0.08 \n0.06\n\n)\n0.04\n0.04\n\n)\n0.02\n0.04\n\n)\n669 \n507\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n(\n\n\u2212\n(\n\n\u2212\n(\n\n)\n\n0.16***\n0.05\n\n(\n)\n0.10** \n0.05\n\n\u2212\n(\n)\n0.10 \n0.07\n\n(\n\n)\n533\n647\n\n)\n\n(\n\n0.10*\n0.05\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n0.02\n0.05\n\n(\n0.07\n0.05\n\n\u2212\n(\n)\n1,503** \n594\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0.11* \n0.06\n\n(\n)\n0.06 \n0.07\n\n\u2212\n(\n)\n0.08 \n0.08\n\n(\n)\n1,378 \n964\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0.05 \n0.09\n\n(\n)\n0.12* \n0.06\n\n\u2212\n)\n(\n0.07 \n0.09\n\n(\n\n(\n\n577\n948\n\n)\n\n)\n\n0.13**\n0.06\n\n)\n\n(\n0.04\n0.06\n\n\u2212\n(\n)\n0.14 \n0.09\n\n(\n)\n1,066\n974\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0.15***\n0.04\n\n(\n)\n0.13***\n0.04\n\n\u2212\n(\n)\n0.05 \n0.06\n\n(\n\n)\n853 \n723\n\n)\n\n(\n\n0.01 \n0.06\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n0.03\n0.06\n\n\u2212\n(\n0.03\n0.07\n\n\u2212\n(\n\n)\n678 \n801\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n(\n\n0.16** \n0.07\n\n)\n\n(\n0.04\n0.06\n\n\u2212\n)\n(\n0.01 \n0.06\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n(\n\n)\n337 \n701\n\n)\n\n0.28***\n0.09\n\n)\n\n(\n0.07\n0.09\n\n(\n)\n0.12 \n0.10\n\n(\n\n)\n\n970\n1,442\n\n0.13*\n0.08\n\n(\n)\n0.27***\n0.10\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n(\n0.07\n0.06\n\n(\n\n)\n297\n647\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n0.07\n0.07\n\n(\n)\n0.15*\n0.09\n\n)\n\n(\n0.15**\n0.08\n\n\u2212\n(\n)\n2,520***\n\n\u2212\n\n896\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0.18*\n0.11\n\n)\n\n(\n0.17**\n0.07\n\n\u2212\n(\n0.02\n0.08\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n512\n869\n\n)\n\n(\n\nDifference between rule-of-thumb and standard accounting\nBusiness practices indexc\n\nAny reporting errorsd\n\nRevenue indexc\n\nSales, bad week \n\nRD$\n\n(\n\ne\n)\n\n0.07\n0.225\n\n[\n\n0.05 \n0.175\n\n\u2212\n[\n0.11 \n0.031\n\n]\n\n]\n\n[\n\n]\n1,635 \n0.003\n\n0.06\n0.328\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n[\n0.12 \n0.016\n\n\u2212\n[\n0.17\n0.044\n\n[\n2,036\n0.010\n\n0.05\n0.449\n\n[\n0.07 \n0.268\n\n[\n0.02 \n0.832\n\n[\n\n801\n0.396\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n0.12 \n0.052\n\n[\n0.00\n0.929\n\n[\n0.17\n0.055\n\n[\n1,743\n0.063\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n0.01 \n0.899\n\n\u2212\n[\n0.09\n0.135\n\n\u2212\n[\n0.04\n0.553\n\n[\n1,190\n0.045\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n0.21\n0.010\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n[\n0.08\n0.368\n\n\u2212\n[\n0.28\n0.014\n\n[\n3,490\n0.014\n\n0.05\n0.501\n\n\u2212\n[\n0.10\n0.239\n\n\u2212\n[\n0.05\n0.493\n\n]\n\n]\n\n[\n\n]\n215\n\u2212\n0.771\n\n0.07 \n0.06\n\n(\n0.03\n0.08\n\n\u2212\n(\n0.14\n0.11\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n942\n1,456\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n0.08 \n0.09\n\n\u2212\n(\n0.07\n0.08\n\n\u2212\n(\n0.13\n0.10\n\n(\n\n)\n735\n\u2212\n1,063\n(\n\n)\n\n0.15\n0.055\n\n[\n0.03\n0.701\n\n[\n0.01\n0.935\n\n[\n1,678 \n0.186\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n[\n\n]\n\n]\n\n[\n\n]\n\n[\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n]\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n1\n\n[\n]\na  Each coefficient reported in the table is the parameter estimate on the indicator for assignment to the rule-\n for the indicated outcome.

It suggests that in certain \ncircumstances the price mechanism may effectively allocate training programs.\n\nThe  last  three  columns  of  Table  4  show  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  had  a \nlarger impact on businesses with poorer management practices in the baseline.25 On \n\n25 Results for the second quartile of baseline business practices are suppressed due to space constraints.

The effects on objective reporting quality and busi-\nness performance are insufficiently precise to draw further conclusions. This might \nsuggest that the rule-of-thumb training allows the people with poor practices ex ante \nto catch up with the others. The ability of the rule-of-thumb training to benefit even \nthe most poorly managed businesses is primarily responsible for its larger average \ntreatment effect and supports the hypothesis that there may be advantages to reduc-\ning the complexity of training programs when targeting micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nThe second panel of Table 4 repeats the exact same set of regressions for the dif-\nferent subsamples for the standard accounting treatment group. There are several \npoints of note. First, the standard accounting treatment improves objective report-\ning quality, but only for high-skilled individuals. The accounting training actually \nincreases reporting errors for businesses in the lowest quartile of baseline business \npractices. Second, those who expressed greater interest in the training ex ante appear \nto change their business practices in response to the accounting training, while those \nwith  less  interest  are  unaffected. This  stands  in  contrast  to  the  pattern  of  hetero-\ngeneity  for  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  which  produced  comparable  and  in  some \ncases larger improvements for those who expressed less interest in training. Finally, \nlower-skilled clients in the accounting training report meaningful drops in their rev-\nenues. These effects are substantial, approximately 0.2 standard deviations from the \nbaseline reported values. Similarly, we find a significant reduction in sales for the \nquartile of clients with the worst business practices in the baseline.\n\nThese results are quite surprising and could be driven by several different chan-\nnels. On the one hand, there could be a negative causal effect of accounting training \non  less  educated  clients  if  they  spend  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  implement  standard \naccounting  techniques  without  much  success. Alternatively  one  could  conjecture \nthat trained clients are more realistic about their actual revenues while prior to the \ntraining they might have been overly optimistic. The relatively large effect on the \nraw difference in reported profits for this subgroup is consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that treated clients may be more aware of their true revenues but the observed \nincrease in reporting errors points in the other direction. Ultimately, we cannot rule \nout either channel.\n\nC. Differences between Rule-of-Thumb and standard Accounting Training\n\nWe  have  shown  above  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  stronger  positive \nimpact across several dimensions than the accounting training, especially on clients \nwith low education and worse business practices relative to the control group. We \nnow compare these two trainings directly to each other. The final panel of Table 4 \nreports the difference in the treatment effect between the rule-of-thumb and account-\ning trainings, and the p-values for testing the equality of treatment effects for all \nsubgroups. Looking across the subgroups, we find a very strong and consistent pat-\ntern according to individuals\u2019 interest in training \n. The rule-of-\n)\nthumb training had a substantially more positive impact than the accounting training \nfor clients that reported limited interest in training ex ante. There is a significantly \nlarger  effect  of  0.12  in  the  index  of  business  practices,  0.21  standard  deviations \n\ncolumns 4 and 5\n\n(\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n21\n\np-value: 0.055\n( \n\np-value: 0.052\n, and a 0.17 difference in the revenue index, 0.20 standard devia-\n)\n( \ntions \n. A similar pattern is observed in bad week sales, with results \nsignificant at approximately the 5 percent level. For those with a strong prior inter-\nest in training, the differences between the two trainings are not significant. On the \nwhole, the rule-of-thumb training generates substantially better outcomes for those \nwith a lower interest in training.\n\n)\n\nWhile not evident in the measures of business practices, we find similar outcomes \nalong the skill dimension in terms of objective reporting quality and business perfor-\nmance. Low-skilled individuals in the rule-of-thumb treatment were 12 percentage \npoints less likely to commit any reporting errors than those in the standard account-\n. This translates into differences in reported revenues, \ning training \np-value: \nwith a difference of 0.17 in the revenue index, 0.20 standard deviations \n( \n0.044\n\np-value: 0.016\n( \n\n)\n\nFinally, we look across quartiles of baseline business practices. In line with the \nfindings above, we see that the clients in the lowest quartile receiving the rule-of-\nthumb training see substantially larger and significant improvements in business and \nfinancial practices relative to those in the accounting training. Again, these results \ntranslate into substantially better sales outcomes. Within the middle quartiles there \nare no significant differences between the two trainings. Surprisingly, the difference \nin  business  practices  reemerges  in  the  top  quartile,  but  these  differences  are  not \nobserved in objective reporting quality or revenues.\n\n.\n)\n\nTaken  together  the  findings  suggest  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  sig-\nnificant and positive effect relative to the accounting training on clients that start \nfrom lower levels of skill, business practices, and interest in training. The same does \nnot  hold  for  higher  skilled,  better  managed  or  more  interested  businesses,  where \nthe impact of both trainings is similar. Not only is the rule-of-thumb training more \nlikely to improve business practices for clients at the lower end of the spectrum, it \nhas real effects on outcomes. This suggests that it is important to correctly match \nthe  characteristics  of  the  clients  with  the  type  of  training  that  will  be  useful  for \nthem.  Giving  an  unsophisticated  client  standard  accounting  training  can  actually \nreduce their performance, while the rule-of-thumb training substantially improves \ntheir outcomes.\n\nD. Robustness checks\n\nFirst, we discuss attrition. Our response rate was relatively high\u201487 percent of \nparticipants were reached for the endline\u2014but we find some evidence for selective \nattrition.  Treatment  group  individuals  who  were  not  reached  for  the  endline  sur-\nvey have generally higher baseline revenues \n than those who \ndropped  from  the  control  group \n.  Given  the  relatively  low \nrevenue  index \nlevel of attrition, this difference of 0.18 standard deviations is not statistically sig-\nnificant.  Nonetheless,  it  suggests  that  the  reported  results  for  business  outcomes \nmay understate the program\u2019s true effect. There are no differences across the two \ntreatment groups.\n\nrevenue index 0.05\n\n0.09\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\nIn addition to survey nonresponse, there is a relatively high incidence of business \nexit:  78  percent  of  individuals  reached  in  the  endline  report  operating  their  own \n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f22 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nbusiness relative to 97 percent in the baseline. As discussed above, qualitative evi-\ndence and discussions with ADOPEM suggest that a string of natural disasters led to \nan unusually high rate of out-migration from the Dominican Republic and business \nexit by the sample population. To test for differential attrition, we estimate a linear \nprobability model of business ownership in the endline on indicators for treatment \nstatus.  Coefficients  for  assignment  to  the  standard  accounting  and  rule-of-thumb \ntrainings are \n\n and 0.001 \nWe analyze the implications for our estimated treatment effects of different plau-\nsible assumptions for the potential outcomes of individuals who are not reached in \nthe endline or who report not having a business. We construct bounds on the treat-\nment effects for the rule-of-thumb training on the business practices index, revenue \nindex, and any reporting errors indicator using a range of assumptions for the pat-\ntern of attrition following an approach based on Horowitz and Manski \n, Lee \n2004\n2002\n\np-value: 0.235\n( \n\np-value: 0.977\n( \n\n, and Kling and Liebman \n\n0.037 \n\n2000\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTable 5 reports these results. Column 4 reproduces the unadjusted results from \nTable 2. Columns 1 and 7 report lower and upper bounds under the worst-case sce-\nnario. We compute worst-case lower bounds by imputing missing values for each \nobservation in the treatment group as the minimum value observed in that group. For \nmissing observations in the control group, we use the maximum value observed in \nthe control group. In practice, because many of the outcomes are binary, this equates \nto assuming that all missing data for the treatment groups is zero and all missing \ndata for the control is one. Worst case upper bounds are computed analogously.\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nWe also consider alternative scenarios for missing observations. Column 2 con-\nstructs a lower bound by imputing missing values for the treatment group as the mean \nfor treatment group minus 0.25 standard deviations of the observed distribution for \nthe group. Missing values for the control group are imputed as the control group \nmean plus 0.25 standard deviations. Column 3 repeats this calculation for 0.10 stan-\ndard deviations. Upper bounds calculated using the same scenarios are reported in \ncolumns 5 and 6. Given the combined magnitude of attrition and business closure, \nthe  worst  case  bounds  are  large  and  uninformative.  The  range  tightens  consider-\nably when we employ plausible assumptions for the missing data. The results for \nbusiness  practices  are  the  most  robust,  maintaining  significance  at  the  10 percent \nlevel up to nearly a 0.50 standard deviation difference between the imputed values \nfor missing treatment and control observations. The effect on reporting errors also \nmaintains statistical significance for a relatively large band of assumptions regard-\ning missing data. Results for the revenue index, which were only marginally sig-\nnificant in the unadjusted results, are the most sensitive to assumptions regarding \nmissing observations.\n\nWe  then  consider  the  effect  of  the  follow-up  training,  with  the  aim  of  under-\nstanding the mechanisms though which training improves or fails to improve out-\ncomes.26 The results, available in Appendix Table A4, are not conclusive.

The results for sales in bad weeks, reported in column 6, follow the \nsame pattern, but none of the differences are significant. Overall these results pro-\nvide suggestive evidence that at least some of the improved sales due to financial \nliteracy training in this setting are due to crowd-out of other businesses.\n\nV.  Conclusion\n\nThe results from this study suggest that training to improve knowledge of finance \nand financial accounting indeed can have a positive effect on the management prac-\ntices of small businesses in an emerging market such as the Dominican Republic. \nHowever, we show that the impact of such training crucially depends on the form in \nwhich financial literacy training is provided. In this setting, a program that relies on \nthe standard approach to small business training, teaching the fundamentals of finan-\ncial accounting, had no measurable effect. But a training program based on simple \nrules of thumb led to significant improvements in the way businesses managed their \nfinances. Businesses in the rule-of-thumb training were more likely to implement \nthe material that was taught, keep accounting records, calculate monthly revenues, \nand separate their business and personal financial records. Moreover, these results \ntranslated into improvements in objective reporting quality and revenues.\n\nBeneath these average results, there is a clear pattern of heterogeneity. The rela-\ntive gains from the rule-of-thumb training were particularly large for firms starting at \nthe lower ends of the performance, ability or interest spectrums. This highlights the \nimportance of precisely evaluating the mechanisms through which training works \nor  does  not  work.  We  do  not  suggest  that  the  value  of  simplification  is  generic. \nRather, we show that one size does not fit all when it comes to training programs. It \nis important to match the training to the targeted client base.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate how rules of thumb can be applied effec-\ntively. We  believe  that  going  forward  it  will  be  important  to  understand  in  more \ndetail the potential costs and benefits of rule-of-thumb-based learning. For example, \nwould more advanced clients do better with more sophisticated training material? \nAre  there  situations  where  rule-of-thumb-based  training  could  make  it  more  dif-\nficult  for  businesses  to  adjust  to  new  circumstances  or  make  sense  of  unforeseen \ndevelopments?\n\nThese results come with two caveats. First, business performance is ultimately \nmeasured by profits not revenue. Not only are small business profits difficult to mea-\nsure, but as we demonstrate, training can affect reporting quality as well as actual \nprofits. Significant methodological improvements are necessary to generate reliable \nmeasures for this important outcome. Second, we find suggestive evidence that at \nleast some of the observed revenue increases come from crowding out sales by other \nfirms in the vicinity. More research is required before we can make conclusive state-\nments about the welfare effects of business training programs.

For  example,  both  the  Standard Accounting  and  Rule-of-\nThumb treatments taught individuals to calculate profits. The Standard Accounting treatment \nfollowed a traditional cash accounting approach: teaching individuals to recognize revenues \nand expenses upon the exchange of cash and calculate revenues as the difference between cash \nincome and cash expenses. The Rule-of-Thumb training taught individuals to write down the \namount of cash physically in the business and to write \u201cIOUs\u201d to the business if they took busi-\nness cash for personal use. Cash profits for any period can then be calculated as the difference \nbetween the ending and starting cash balance.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n5\n(\n\n)\n\nBerge, Lars Ivar Oppedal, Kjetil Bjorvatn, Kartika Sari Juniwaty, and Bertil Tungodden. 2012. \u201cBusi-\nness Training in Tanzania: From Research-driven Experiment to Local Implementation.\u201d Journal of \nAfrican Economics 21 \n\n: 808\u201327.\n\n: 435\u201365.\n)\n\n(\n\nplace: Evidence from a Survey of Households.\u201d Journal of public Economics 87 \n7\u20138\n(\n\nBernheim, B.

These \nspillovers  can  take  two  forms.  First,  there  may  be  positive  knowledge  spillovers. \nTrained  clients  may  actively  pass  on  newly  acquired  knowledge  to  their  peers  or \nneighboring businesses may observe and mimic improved management practices. \nSecond,  business  outcomes  for  the  treated  may  improve  either  by  expanding  the \noverall  market,  \u201cgrowing  the  pie\u201d,  or  by  a  reallocation  of  revenues  from  control \nfirms to the treated, \u201cbusiness stealing\u201d. As described above, the businesses in this \nstudy tend to serve spatially local markets, therefore we follow a strategy similar to \n in testing for these externalities.

The  estimated  effect  on  the  business  practices  index  is  0.07, \np-value: \napproximately  0.12  standard  deviations,  but  not  statistically  significant \n( \n0.198\n. Among the component elements, only the estimated effect on setting aside \n)\nfunds for business expenses is significant at the 10 percent level or better. Estimates \nfor the other business practice outcomes, while all positive, are not statistically sig-\nnificant and generally close to zero.\n\nIn  contrast,  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  reported  in  column  4,  substantially \nincreases the likelihood that individuals adopt better financial practices. Clients in \nthat treatment group report a higher likelihood of separating business and personal \ncash, keeping accounting records, separating business and personal accounts, set-\nting aside cash for business, and calculating revenues formally. Each of these mea-\nsures  increases  by  6 to 12  percentage  points  relative  to  the  control  group,  which \ndid not receive training, and all are significant at the 5 percent level or better. The \nrule-of-thumb  treatment  also  produces  a  significant  0.14  increase  in  the  business \npractices index, approximately 0.25 standard deviations. When looking at savings \nbehavior, we find a marginally significant impact of the rule-of-thumb training on \nthe likelihood of having any savings. The increase in total reported savings, while \nlarge, is not significant. Column 5 reports the p-values for tests of the equality of the \nstandard accounting and rule-of-thumb treatment effects. When considering the full \nsample, the rule-of-thumb training has a consistently more positive effect. The dif-\nferential impact on both separating business and personal cash and keeping account-\ning  records  are  significant  at  the  10  percent  level  or  better,  but  despite  the  rather \nlarge difference we cannot reject equality for the impact on the index of business \npractices.\n\n)\n\nThe second set of results shows the impact of training on measures of objective \nreporting  quality.

Individuals in both treatment groups \nsee Section IIIB for a detailed description\n(\nare less likely to make any such mistakes. However, only for the rule-of-thumb train-\ning is the improvement significant, with treated individuals 8 percentage points less \nlikely to make any errors. Similarly, both treatments appear to reduce differences \nbetween directly reported profits and profits calculated from respondents\u2019 reported \nrevenues  and  expenses.

As  noted,  individuals \nassigned  to  the  rule-of-thumb  training  reported  lower  sales  in  these  periods  than \nthose assigned to the control group. These differences in baseline revenues are not \nsignificant at conventional levels; however, the treatment effect is insignificant when \ni.e., \nthe controls for baseline sales are dropped.

The findings remain \nconsistent with the possibility that effective training may operate by helping indi-\nviduals to better manage negative shocks or by alerting them to such shocks such \nthat they can counteract the effect of slow weeks.

There is no evidence that the rule-of-thumb training \ncauses any other changes in institutional outcomes.\n\nB. Heterogeneous Treatment Effects\n\nThe  efficacy  of  different  training  programs  is  likely  to  vary  through  the  popu-\nlation.  Table  4  reports  whether  the  rule-of-thumb  and  standard  accounting  train-\nings  have  heterogeneous  treatment  effects  for  different  subgroups.  We  focus  on \nthree dimensions along which we expected training may have differential effects. \nFirst, we classify an individual as high-skilled if she has completed high school or \nreceived previous formal financial training and low-skilled otherwise. Differences \nin  treatment  effects  along  this  dimension  allow  us  to  test  whether  the  effective-\nness of training depends on initial levels of human capital. Second, we classify an \nindividual as interested in training if she indicated in the baseline survey a desire to \nreceive training in business accounting or financial management and not otherwise. \nDifferences along this dimension allow us to test whether the effectiveness of train-\ning depends on a participant\u2019s motivation. Third, we compare individuals across the \nquartiles of baseline business management practices.\n\nColumns 2 and 3 compare the impact of the trainings across different levels of \ninitial  human  capital.  The  first  row  in  each  panel  focuses  on  whether  the  clients \nadopted  better  business  practices. The  impacts  of  the  rule-of-thumb  treatment  on \n business  practices  appear  independent  of  skill  level;  both  subgroups  show  large \nand significant improvements. We then look at our different measures of objective \nreporting quality. Across both skill levels, we find that the rule-of-thumb treatment, \non average, reduced the likelihood that individuals made reporting errors, although \nthe results are only significant for low-skill individuals. Finally, we also test whether \nthere is a differential impact on business outcomes. The coefficients for the impact \non the revenue measures are positive for both groups, but none of the effects is sig-\nnificant when splitting the sample by skill level.24\n\nColumns 4 and 5 repeat the heterogeneous treatment analysis along the dimension \nof interest in training. Again, we find a positive effect on both groups, with similar \nand significant magnitudes. Objective reporting quality improves for both groups, \nwith  a  larger  effect for those expressing  greater interest in training. There are  no \nsignificant differences in the business performance measures across the groups.\n\nThis stands in contrast to the results of Karlan and Valdivia \n\n, which finds \n)\nthat less interested clients benefitted more from the training. We hypothesize that this  \n\n2011\n(\n\n24 The results for employment, not reported here but available from the authors, are interesting. The rule-of-\nthumb treatment reduces the number of employees for the low-skill group but increases employment in the busi-\nnesses  of  the  high-skilled  group.

The effects on objective reporting quality and busi-\nness performance are insufficiently precise to draw further conclusions. This might \nsuggest that the rule-of-thumb training allows the people with poor practices ex ante \nto catch up with the others. The ability of the rule-of-thumb training to benefit even \nthe most poorly managed businesses is primarily responsible for its larger average \ntreatment effect and supports the hypothesis that there may be advantages to reduc-\ning the complexity of training programs when targeting micro-entrepreneurs.\n\nThe second panel of Table 4 repeats the exact same set of regressions for the dif-\nferent subsamples for the standard accounting treatment group. There are several \npoints of note. First, the standard accounting treatment improves objective report-\ning quality, but only for high-skilled individuals. The accounting training actually \nincreases reporting errors for businesses in the lowest quartile of baseline business \npractices. Second, those who expressed greater interest in the training ex ante appear \nto change their business practices in response to the accounting training, while those \nwith  less  interest  are  unaffected. This  stands  in  contrast  to  the  pattern  of  hetero-\ngeneity  for  the  rule-of-thumb  training,  which  produced  comparable  and  in  some \ncases larger improvements for those who expressed less interest in training. Finally, \nlower-skilled clients in the accounting training report meaningful drops in their rev-\nenues. These effects are substantial, approximately 0.2 standard deviations from the \nbaseline reported values. Similarly, we find a significant reduction in sales for the \nquartile of clients with the worst business practices in the baseline.\n\nThese results are quite surprising and could be driven by several different chan-\nnels. On the one hand, there could be a negative causal effect of accounting training \non  less  educated  clients  if  they  spend  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  implement  standard \naccounting  techniques  without  much  success. Alternatively  one  could  conjecture \nthat trained clients are more realistic about their actual revenues while prior to the \ntraining they might have been overly optimistic. The relatively large effect on the \nraw difference in reported profits for this subgroup is consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that treated clients may be more aware of their true revenues but the observed \nincrease in reporting errors points in the other direction. Ultimately, we cannot rule \nout either channel.\n\nC. Differences between Rule-of-Thumb and standard Accounting Training\n\nWe  have  shown  above  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  stronger  positive \nimpact across several dimensions than the accounting training, especially on clients \nwith low education and worse business practices relative to the control group. We \nnow compare these two trainings directly to each other. The final panel of Table 4 \nreports the difference in the treatment effect between the rule-of-thumb and account-\ning trainings, and the p-values for testing the equality of treatment effects for all \nsubgroups. Looking across the subgroups, we find a very strong and consistent pat-\ntern according to individuals\u2019 interest in training \n. The rule-of-\n)\nthumb training had a substantially more positive impact than the accounting training \nfor clients that reported limited interest in training ex ante.

A similar pattern is observed in bad week sales, with results \nsignificant at approximately the 5 percent level. For those with a strong prior inter-\nest in training, the differences between the two trainings are not significant. On the \nwhole, the rule-of-thumb training generates substantially better outcomes for those \nwith a lower interest in training.\n\n)\n\nWhile not evident in the measures of business practices, we find similar outcomes \nalong the skill dimension in terms of objective reporting quality and business perfor-\nmance.

In line with the \nfindings above, we see that the clients in the lowest quartile receiving the rule-of-\nthumb training see substantially larger and significant improvements in business and \nfinancial practices relative to those in the accounting training. Again, these results \ntranslate into substantially better sales outcomes. Within the middle quartiles there \nare no significant differences between the two trainings. Surprisingly, the difference \nin  business  practices  reemerges  in  the  top  quartile,  but  these  differences  are  not \nobserved in objective reporting quality or revenues.\n\n.\n)\n\nTaken  together  the  findings  suggest  that  the  rule-of-thumb  training  has  a  sig-\nnificant and positive effect relative to the accounting training on clients that start \nfrom lower levels of skill, business practices, and interest in training. The same does \nnot  hold  for  higher  skilled,  better  managed  or  more  interested  businesses,  where \nthe impact of both trainings is similar. Not only is the rule-of-thumb training more \nlikely to improve business practices for clients at the lower end of the spectrum, it \nhas real effects on outcomes. This suggests that it is important to correctly match \nthe  characteristics  of  the  clients  with  the  type  of  training  that  will  be  useful  for \nthem.  Giving  an  unsophisticated  client  standard  accounting  training  can  actually \nreduce their performance, while the rule-of-thumb training substantially improves \ntheir outcomes.\n\nD. Robustness checks\n\nFirst, we discuss attrition. Our response rate was relatively high\u201487 percent of \nparticipants were reached for the endline\u2014but we find some evidence for selective \nattrition.  Treatment  group  individuals  who  were  not  reached  for  the  endline  sur-\nvey have generally higher baseline revenues \n than those who \ndropped  from  the  control  group \n.  Given  the  relatively  low \nrevenue  index \nlevel of attrition, this difference of 0.18 standard deviations is not statistically sig-\nnificant.  Nonetheless,  it  suggests  that  the  reported  results  for  business  outcomes \nmay understate the program\u2019s true effect. There are no differences across the two \ntreatment groups.\n\nrevenue index 0.05\n\n0.09\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\nIn addition to survey nonresponse, there is a relatively high incidence of business \nexit:  78  percent  of  individuals  reached  in  the  endline  report  operating  their  own \n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f22 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nbusiness relative to 97 percent in the baseline. As discussed above, qualitative evi-\ndence and discussions with ADOPEM suggest that a string of natural disasters led to \nan unusually high rate of out-migration from the Dominican Republic and business \nexit by the sample population. To test for differential attrition, we estimate a linear \nprobability model of business ownership in the endline on indicators for treatment \nstatus.  Coefficients  for  assignment  to  the  standard  accounting  and  rule-of-thumb \ntrainings are \n\n and 0.001 \nWe analyze the implications for our estimated treatment effects of different plau-\nsible assumptions for the potential outcomes of individuals who are not reached in \nthe endline or who report not having a business. We construct bounds on the treat-\nment effects for the rule-of-thumb training on the business practices index, revenue \nindex, and any reporting errors indicator using a range of assumptions for the pat-\ntern of attrition following an approach based on Horowitz and Manski \n, Lee \n2004\n2002\n\np-value: 0.235\n( \n\np-value: 0.977\n( \n\n, and Kling and Liebman \n\n0.037 \n\n2000\n\n\u2212\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTable 5 reports these results. Column 4 reproduces the unadjusted results from \nTable 2. Columns 1 and 7 report lower and upper bounds under the worst-case sce-\nnario. We compute worst-case lower bounds by imputing missing values for each \nobservation in the treatment group as the minimum value observed in that group. For \nmissing observations in the control group, we use the maximum value observed in \nthe control group. In practice, because many of the outcomes are binary, this equates \nto assuming that all missing data for the treatment groups is zero and all missing \ndata for the control is one. Worst case upper bounds are computed analogously.\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nWe also consider alternative scenarios for missing observations. Column 2 con-\nstructs a lower bound by imputing missing values for the treatment group as the mean \nfor treatment group minus 0.25 standard deviations of the observed distribution for \nthe group. Missing values for the control group are imputed as the control group \nmean plus 0.25 standard deviations. Column 3 repeats this calculation for 0.10 stan-\ndard deviations. Upper bounds calculated using the same scenarios are reported in \ncolumns 5 and 6. Given the combined magnitude of attrition and business closure, \nthe  worst  case  bounds  are  large  and  uninformative.  The  range  tightens  consider-\nably when we employ plausible assumptions for the missing data. The results for \nbusiness  practices  are  the  most  robust,  maintaining  significance  at  the  10 percent \nlevel up to nearly a 0.50 standard deviation difference between the imputed values \nfor missing treatment and control observations. The effect on reporting errors also \nmaintains statistical significance for a relatively large band of assumptions regard-\ning missing data. Results for the revenue index, which were only marginally sig-\nnificant in the unadjusted results, are the most sensitive to assumptions regarding \nmissing observations.\n\nWe  then  consider  the  effect  of  the  follow-up  training,  with  the  aim  of  under-\nstanding the mechanisms though which training improves or fails to improve out-\ncomes.26 The results, available in Appendix Table A4, are not conclusive.

The results for sales in bad weeks, reported in column 6, follow the \nsame pattern, but none of the differences are significant. Overall these results pro-\nvide suggestive evidence that at least some of the improved sales due to financial \nliteracy training in this setting are due to crowd-out of other businesses.\n\nV.  Conclusion\n\nThe results from this study suggest that training to improve knowledge of finance \nand financial accounting indeed can have a positive effect on the management prac-\ntices of small businesses in an emerging market such as the Dominican Republic. \nHowever, we show that the impact of such training crucially depends on the form in \nwhich financial literacy training is provided. In this setting, a program that relies on \nthe standard approach to small business training, teaching the fundamentals of finan-\ncial accounting, had no measurable effect. But a training program based on simple \nrules of thumb led to significant improvements in the way businesses managed their \nfinances. Businesses in the rule-of-thumb training were more likely to implement \nthe material that was taught, keep accounting records, calculate monthly revenues, \nand separate their business and personal financial records. Moreover, these results \ntranslated into improvements in objective reporting quality and revenues.\n\nBeneath these average results, there is a clear pattern of heterogeneity. The rela-\ntive gains from the rule-of-thumb training were particularly large for firms starting at \nthe lower ends of the performance, ability or interest spectrums. This highlights the \nimportance of precisely evaluating the mechanisms through which training works \nor  does  not  work.  We  do  not  suggest  that  the  value  of  simplification  is  generic. \nRather, we show that one size does not fit all when it comes to training programs. It \nis important to match the training to the targeted client base.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate how rules of thumb can be applied effec-\ntively. We  believe  that  going  forward  it  will  be  important  to  understand  in  more \ndetail the potential costs and benefits of rule-of-thumb-based learning. For example, \nwould more advanced clients do better with more sophisticated training material? \nAre  there  situations  where  rule-of-thumb-based  training  could  make  it  more  dif-\nficult  for  businesses  to  adjust  to  new  circumstances  or  make  sense  of  unforeseen \ndevelopments?\n\nThese results come with two caveats. First, business performance is ultimately \nmeasured by profits not revenue. Not only are small business profits difficult to mea-\nsure, but as we demonstrate, training can affect reporting quality as well as actual \nprofits. Significant methodological improvements are necessary to generate reliable \nmeasures for this important outcome. Second, we find suggestive evidence that at \nleast some of the observed revenue increases come from crowding out sales by other \nfirms in the vicinity. More research is required before we can make conclusive state-\nments about the welfare effects of business training programs. Nevertheless, based \non these findings, it appears that in at least some contexts significant gains could be \nmade from simplifying training programs and relying more on easy-to-implement, \npractical rules of thumb.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple\f26 \n\nAMERicAn EconoMic JouRnAL: AppLiED EconoMics \n\nApRiL 2014\n\nAppendix: Description of Training Programs\n\nTable A1\u2014 Summary of Training Programs\n\nClass 1\n\nClass 2\n\nClass 3\n\nClass 4\n\nClass 5\n\nRule of thumb\n\nSavings \n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002we\u2002should\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Set\u2002saving\u2002goals\n\u2022\u2002 Save\u2002for\u2002emergencies\n\u2022\u2002 Decide\u2002how\u2002to\u2002save\n\u2022\u2002 Compare\u2002saving\u2002services\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002savings\n\nConsumption\n\u2022\u2002 Financial\u2002burden\n\u2022\u2002 Study\u2002your\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\n\u2022\u2002 Plan\u2002your\u2002future\u2002income\u2002&\u2002expenses\n\nDebt management\n\u2022\u2002 Why\u2002borrowing\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002much\u2002debt\u2002I\u2002can\u2002afford\n\u2022\u2002 Default,\u2002what\u2002is\u2002it\u2002and\u2002how\u2002it\u2002happens\n\u2022\u2002 Cost\u2002of\u2002default\u2002and\u2002excessive\u2002debt\n\nAccount separation\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Why\u2002separate\u2002money\u2002for\u2002the\u2002household\u2002\n\nfrom money for the business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Separating\u2002household\u2002and\u2002business\u2002money\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Setting\u2002ourselves\u2002a\u2002salary\u2002\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002recognize\u2002and\u2002keep\u2002records\u2002of\u2002\nflows between business and household\n\nEstimation methods\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002total\u2002monthly\u2002flow\u2002of\u2002money\u2002\n\nbetween household and business\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimate\u2002increase/decrease\u2002of\u2002money\u2002in\u2002\nthe business between beginning and end \nof the month\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\n\nClass 6\n\nNone\n\nAccounting\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nSame\n\nBasic Accounting 1\n\u2022\u2002 Relevance\u2002of\u2002accounting\n\u2022\u2002 How\u2002to\u2002record\u2002expenses\u2002and\u2002revenues\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002estimate\u2002and\u2002record\u2002daily\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002profits\u2002using\u2002revenue\u2002and\u2002expense\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Understanding\u2002the\u2002difference\u2002between\u2002cash\u2002\n\naccumulation and profits\n\nBasic Accounting 2\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Recording\u2002personal\u2002income\u2002and\u2002expenses\u2002in\u2002\n\nbusiness accounts\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Estimating\u2002nonoperational\u2002(personal)\u2002cash\u2002\n\noutflows and inflows.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Incorporating\u2002personal\u2002cashflows\u2002into\u2002profit\u2002\n\nestimation.\n\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002How\u2002to\u2002include\u2002fixed\u2002costs\u2002into\u2002the\u2002profit\u2002\n\ncalculations\n\nBasic Accounting 3\n\u2022\u2002 \u2002Aggregating\u2002daily\u2002records\u2002into\u2002monthly\u2002\n\nrecords\n\n\u2022\u2002 Calculating\u2002monthly\u2002profit\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002payable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\u2022\u2002 Accounts\u2002receivable\u2002record\u2002keeping\n\n\fVoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n27\n\nTable A2\u2014Determinants of Attendance Conditional on Assignment to Treatment\n\nDependent variable\n\nFemale\n\nNumber of children\n\nHigh skillb\n\nAny savings\n\nInterested in accounting and financial training\n\nCurrent loan \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nLoan planned for fixed assets \n\nRD$0000\n(\n\n)\n\nRevenue indexc\n\nBusiness practices indexc\n\nBuy-sell businessd\n\nReports business improving\n\nConstant\n\nAttend any classa\n1\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.081\n0.063\n0.035***\n0.011\n0.104***\n0.040\n)\n0.011\n0.039\n0.074**\n0.036\n0.003\n0.011\n0.023**\n0.010\n)\n0.047*\n0.028\n0.045\n0.034\n)\n0.010\n0.037\n0.054**\n0.025\n0.197**\n0.083\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nAttend any classa\n2\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n(\n0.062\n0.061\n0.032***\n0.011\n0.109***\n0.039\n)\n0.016\n0.038\n0.081**\n0.035\n0.000\n0.011\n0.024**\n0.010\n)\n0.050*\n0.028\n0.035\n0.033\n)\n0.020\n0.036\n0.051**\n0.024\n0.191**\n0.080\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\u2212\n(\n\nObservations\nImpute values for missing data\n\n762 \nNo \n\n806\nYes\n\na  OLS regression of attending any class on the indicated set of variables, conditional on \nassignment to either treatment group. \nb  High skill indicates individuals with high school or greater formal education or previous \nfinancial trading.\nc  Indices are unweighted mean of z-scores of all component elements, scaled by control \ngroup mean and standard deviation, as detailed in Section IVC.

                "Text": "VoL. 6 no. 2 \n\n25\n\ncauses a firm\u2019s revenue index to fall by approximately 0.03 standard deviations for \nboth the accounting and rule-of-thumb treatments with p-values of 0.077 and 0.023, \nrespectively. The results for sales in bad weeks, reported in column 6, follow the \nsame pattern, but none of the differences are significant. Overall these results pro-\nvide suggestive evidence that at least some of the improved sales due to financial \nliteracy training in this setting are due to crowd-out of other businesses.\n\nV.  Conclusion\n\nThe results from this study suggest that training to improve knowledge of finance \nand financial accounting indeed can have a positive effect on the management prac-\ntices of small businesses in an emerging market such as the Dominican Republic. \nHowever, we show that the impact of such training crucially depends on the form in \nwhich financial literacy training is provided. In this setting, a program that relies on \nthe standard approach to small business training, teaching the fundamentals of finan-\ncial accounting, had no measurable effect. But a training program based on simple \nrules of thumb led to significant improvements in the way businesses managed their \nfinances. Businesses in the rule-of-thumb training were more likely to implement \nthe material that was taught, keep accounting records, calculate monthly revenues, \nand separate their business and personal financial records. Moreover, these results \ntranslated into improvements in objective reporting quality and revenues.\n\nBeneath these average results, there is a clear pattern of heterogeneity. The rela-\ntive gains from the rule-of-thumb training were particularly large for firms starting at \nthe lower ends of the performance, ability or interest spectrums. This highlights the \nimportance of precisely evaluating the mechanisms through which training works \nor  does  not  work.  We  do  not  suggest  that  the  value  of  simplification  is  generic. \nRather, we show that one size does not fit all when it comes to training programs. It \nis important to match the training to the targeted client base.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate how rules of thumb can be applied effec-\ntively. We  believe  that  going  forward  it  will  be  important  to  understand  in  more \ndetail the potential costs and benefits of rule-of-thumb-based learning. For example, \nwould more advanced clients do better with more sophisticated training material? \nAre  there  situations  where  rule-of-thumb-based  training  could  make  it  more  dif-\nficult  for  businesses  to  adjust  to  new  circumstances  or  make  sense  of  unforeseen \ndevelopments?\n\nThese results come with two caveats. First, business performance is ultimately \nmeasured by profits not revenue. Not only are small business profits difficult to mea-\nsure, but as we demonstrate, training can affect reporting quality as well as actual \nprofits. Significant methodological improvements are necessary to generate reliable \nmeasures for this important outcome. Second, we find suggestive evidence that at \nleast some of the observed revenue increases come from crowding out sales by other \nfirms in the vicinity. More research is required before we can make conclusive state-\nments about the welfare effects of business training programs. Nevertheless, based \non these findings, it appears that in at least some contexts significant gains could be \nmade from simplifying training programs and relying more on easy-to-implement, \npractical rules of thumb.\n\ndrexler, fischer, and schoar: keeping it simple"

Note  that  while  there  was \nsubstantial  overlap  in  the  topics  covered  by  each  training,  topics  included  in  both  were  not \nnecessarily  covered  equivalently.  For  example,  both  the  Standard Accounting  and  Rule-of-\nThumb treatments taught individuals to calculate profits. The Standard Accounting treatment \nfollowed a traditional cash accounting approach: teaching individuals to recognize revenues \nand expenses upon the exchange of cash and calculate revenues as the difference between cash \nincome and cash expenses. The Rule-of-Thumb training taught individuals to write down the \namount of cash physically in the business and to write \u201cIOUs\u201d to the business if they took busi-\nness cash for personal use. Cash profits for any period can then be calculated as the difference \nbetween the ending and starting cash balance.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n5\n(\n\n)\n\nBerge, Lars Ivar Oppedal, Kjetil Bjorvatn, Kartika Sari Juniwaty, and Bertil Tungodden. 2012. \u201cBusi-\nness Training in Tanzania: From Research-driven Experiment to Local Implementation.\u201d Journal of \nAfrican Economics 21 \n\n: 808\u201327.\n\n: 435\u201365.\n)\n\n(\n\nplace: Evidence from a Survey of Households.\u201d Journal of public Economics 87 \n7\u20138\n(\n\nBernheim, B.
