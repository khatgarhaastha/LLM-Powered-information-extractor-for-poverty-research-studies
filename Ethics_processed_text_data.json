Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.) Divisions (324), and Grama Niladari\n(G.N.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We included a 400 Rs\nper day attendance payment to cover basic transport cost (estimated at\n50 Rs per day) and the opportunity cost of attending. We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29.

Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.) Divisions (324), and Grama Niladari\n(G.N.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1.

Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Neither interaction between treatment\nand ability is statistically signi\ufb01cant when we look at the two treatment\neffects separately, but we do \ufb01nd an effect on business closure which is\nsigni\ufb01cant at the 10% level if we pool the two treatments (p = 0.085).\nThe results suggest that skilled women are no less likely to have ever\nstarted a business if they are trained, but are more likely to have closed\n\na business. The last two columns of appendix Table 3 show that higher\nability treated women are no more likely to be wage workers, but are\nmore likely to be out of the labor force. This is particularly true among\nthose eligible for both training and cash. Panel B of the table shows no\nsigni\ufb01cant heterogeneity with respect to our other measure of ability,\nthe digitspan recall. The correlation between Raven score and digitspan\nin this sample is only 0.18.

Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We included a 400 Rs\nper day attendance payment to cover basic transport cost (estimated at\n50 Rs per day) and the opportunity cost of attending. We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.) Divisions (324), and Grama Niladari\n(G.N.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We included a 400 Rs\nper day attendance payment to cover basic transport cost (estimated at\n50 Rs per day) and the opportunity cost of attending. We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

The last two columns of appendix Table 3 show that higher\nability treated women are no more likely to be wage workers, but are\nmore likely to be out of the labor force. This is particularly true among\nthose eligible for both training and cash.

We included a 400 Rs\nper day attendance payment to cover basic transport cost (estimated at\n50 Rs per day) and the opportunity cost of attending. We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes.

Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al.

(2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

B: CDF of\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of current enterprises at last follow-up survey.\n\nthe point estimate on pro\ufb01ts is much smaller by rounds 4 and 5.11 This is\nseen also in Fig. 2B, where the CDF of pro\ufb01ts in round 5 is almost on top\nof that of the other two groups. The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect.

Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.) Divisions (324), and Grama Niladari\n(G.N.) Divisions (14,008).\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n201\n\nJan 2009 \n\nApril \n\nBaseline \n\n/May \n\n2009 \n\nTraining\n\nSept \n2009 \n\nRound \n2 \nsurvey \n\nJan \n2010 \n\nRound \n3 \nsurvey \n\nSept \n2010 \n\nRound \n4 \nsurvey \n\nFig. 1.

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

B: CDF of\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of current enterprises at last follow-up survey.\n\nthe point estimate on pro\ufb01ts is much smaller by rounds 4 and 5.11 This is\nseen also in Fig. 2B, where the CDF of pro\ufb01ts in round 5 is almost on top\nof that of the other two groups. The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect.

Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Neither interaction between treatment\nand ability is statistically signi\ufb01cant when we look at the two treatment\neffects separately, but we do \ufb01nd an effect on business closure which is\nsigni\ufb01cant at the 10% level if we pool the two treatments (p = 0.085).\nThe results suggest that skilled women are no less likely to have ever\nstarted a business if they are trained, but are more likely to have closed\n\na business. The last two columns of appendix Table 3 show that higher\nability treated women are no more likely to be wage workers, but are\nmore likely to be out of the labor force. This is particularly true among\nthose eligible for both training and cash. Panel B of the table shows no\nsigni\ufb01cant heterogeneity with respect to our other measure of ability,\nthe digitspan recall. The correlation between Raven score and digitspan\nin this sample is only 0.18.

The\nlast four columns provide some suggestive evidence that the cash grant\nled women from higher wealth households to be more likely to close a\nbusiness and be out of the labor force in round 5, but neither effect is\nsigni\ufb01cant at the 10% level (the interaction with the cash treatment has\np-value 0.138 for being out of the labor force).\n\nAppendix Table 3: Do the grants affect the selection of who owns\n\na business?\n\nReferences\n\nAttanasio, O., Augsburg, B., de Haas, R., Fitzsimons, E., and Harmgart, H., 2011. \u201cGroup\nlending or individual lending?

(1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70).

These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;"

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects.

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

B: CDF of\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of current enterprises at last follow-up survey.\n\nthe point estimate on pro\ufb01ts is much smaller by rounds 4 and 5.11 This is\nseen also in Fig. 2B, where the CDF of pro\ufb01ts in round 5 is almost on top\nof that of the other two groups. The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

The last two columns of appendix Table 3 show that higher\nability treated women are no more likely to be wage workers, but are\nmore likely to be out of the labor force. This is particularly true among\nthose eligible for both training and cash.

The cash and training treatment appears to have in-\nduced poorer individuals to start a business, but also to have reduced busi-\nness ownership in round 5 among individuals from richer households. The\nlast four columns provide some suggestive evidence that the cash grant\nled women from higher wealth households to be more likely to close a\nbusiness and be out of the labor force in round 5, but neither effect is\nsigni\ufb01cant at the 10% level (the interaction with the cash treatment has\np-value 0.138 for being out of the labor force).\n\nAppendix Table 3: Do the grants affect the selection of who owns\n\na business?\n\nReferences\n\nAttanasio, O., Augsburg, B., de Haas, R., Fitzsimons, E., and Harmgart, H., 2011. \u201cGroup\nlending or individual lending?

B: CDF of\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of current enterprises at last follow-up survey.\n\nthe point estimate on pro\ufb01ts is much smaller by rounds 4 and 5.11 This is\nseen also in Fig. 2B, where the CDF of pro\ufb01ts in round 5 is almost on top\nof that of the other two groups. The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect.

Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al.

(2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

B: CDF of\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of current enterprises at last follow-up survey.\n\nthe point estimate on pro\ufb01ts is much smaller by rounds 4 and 5.11 This is\nseen also in Fig. 2B, where the CDF of pro\ufb01ts in round 5 is almost on top\nof that of the other two groups. The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect.

Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1.

The grant plus training combination increases\nbusiness pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst eight months, but this impact dissipates in the second year. Among potential\nstartups, business training hastens entry \u2013 without changing longer-term ownership rates \u2013 and increases\npro\ufb01tability. We conclude that training may be more effective for new owners.\n\n\u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We included a 400 Rs\nper day attendance payment to cover basic transport cost (estimated at\n50 Rs per day) and the opportunity cost of attending. We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war. GDP growth was 8.0%\nin 2010 and 8.3% in 2011, the highest growth level since Sri Lanka's\nindependence.9 Growth was widespread through manufacturing and\n\n9 http://www.statistics.gov.lk/national_accounts/PressRelease/\n\nPRESSNOTE2011AnnualEnglish.pdf [accessed 23 May, 2012].\n\n\fTable 2\nImpact on business practices of current enterprises.\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n203\n\nTotal practices score\n\nMarketing\n\nStock control\n\nRecord keeping\n\nFinancial planning\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\nAll rounds\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIntent-to-treat effects\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTreatment on the treated\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.530\n(0.555)\n1.719\n(0.555)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.588\n(0.591)\n2.192\n(0.540)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.936\n(0.567)\n1.708\n(0.560)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.790\n(0.607)\n2.261\n(0.546)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.109\n(0.570)\n\u204e\n1.075\n(0.568)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.122\n(0.631)\n1.489\n(0.580)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2.087\n(0.326)\n1.524\n(0.326)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n3.059\n(0.429)\n2.031\n(0.389)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.379\n(0.109)\n0.433\n(0.113)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.552\n(0.147)\n0.574\n(0.136)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.230\n(0.0603)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.125\n(0.0638)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.338\n(0.0819)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.167\n(0.0783)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.872\n(0.154)\n0.483\n(0.148)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n1.281\n(0.204)\n0.645\n(0.178)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.628\n(0.132)\n0.535\n(0.140)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.917\n(0.174)\n0.711\n(0.168)\n\nObservations\nFirms\np-Value for testing two treatments equal\nBaseline mean:\n\n544\n544\n\n0.154\n4.96\n\n513\n513\n\n0.690\n5.02\n\n506\n506\n\n0.080\n4.98\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.099\n4.96\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.622\n1.66\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.09\n0.53\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.01\n2.10\n\n1563\n573\n\n0.533\n0.64\n\nRobust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nTotal business practices score is a score of business practices used, with a maximum of 29, de\ufb01ned in Appendix 1.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include baseline outcome value and controls for randomization strata, and columns 4\u20138 also include survey round dummies.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Introduction\n\nSelf-employment accounts for a large share of female employment\nin most developing countries, and it is considered an important avenue\nfor women's economic empowerment. However, the majority of\nfemale-owned enterprises are small in scale with commensurately\nlow earning levels (Banerjee and Du\ufb02o 2008; de Mel et al., 2009a;\nKevane and Wydick, 2001). Moreover, in much of South Asia and the\nMiddle East, the majority of women remain out of the labor force.\nThese facts frame the central question addressed in this paper: Can\nbusiness training, by itself or combined with a grant, raise the income\nof women in self employment?\n\nIn previous experiments in Sri Lanka (de Mel et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2012) and Ghana (Fafchamps et al., 2011) we have found that physical\ncapital alone is not enough to raise the incomes of subsistence-level\n\n\u2606 The authors thank the World Bank's Gender Action Plan and Research Support\nBudgets for funding for this project, and the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick\nfor providing a part of Woodruff's time, Matthew Groh for valuable research assistance,\nand the editor, an anonymous referee, Alan de Brauw and various seminar audiences for\nhelpful comments.

One reason for this is that labor market imper-\nfections may draw women with low levels of business skills into self-\nemployment rather than wage work (Emran et al., 2007). A common\npolicy response is to attempt to improve the skill level of these\nwomen through business training.\n\nWe evaluate the impact of the most common training course in\ndeveloping countries, the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s\nStart-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) program. This program has\nbeen given to over 4.5 million people in more than 95 countries world-\nwide. Using a randomized design, we test whether the impact of train-\ning alone differs from that of training coupled with access to capital in\nthe form of an unrestricted grant. We work with two samples. The\n\ufb01rst sample consists of 624 women operating a business and earning\nan income of less than $2 per day. The second sample consists of\n628 women who were out of the labor force at baseline, but who\nexpressed interest in starting a business within the next year. We\nrefer to the \ufb01rst sample as \u201ccurrent business owners\u201d and the second\nas \u201cpotential business owners.\u201d Each sample is randomized into\nthree groups: a control group, a group invited to attend training,\nand a group invited to receive training and a grant of around $130\nconditional on completing training.\n\nAmong the sample of current business owners, we \ufb01nd that training\nalone leads to some changes in business practices, but has no effect on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales or capital stock. In contrast the combination of\ntraining and a grant leads to large and signi\ufb01cant short-run improve-\nments in business performance for the current enterprises, but these\n\n\f200\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\ngains appear to have dissipated two years after training. Among the\nsample of potential business owners, training \u2013 and especially training\ncombined with a grant \u2013 speeds up the process of starting a business.\nWomen assigned to either training treatment are more likely to be\noperating a business four months and eight months after the training\ncourse, but this entry effect disappears 16 months after training. How-\never, training does appear to enable more successful businesses to be\nstarted, with potential entrants assigned to training having higher\npro\ufb01ts and better management practices two years after completion\nof training than businesses started by the control group.\n\nThis study contributes to a growing literature of business training\nexperiments with women (or with men and women) in developing\ncountries.1 These studies typically involve micro\ufb01nance clients \u2013 most\nof them existing business owners \u2013 whose progress is evaluated by a\nsingle follow-up survey measuring outcomes six months to one year\nafter training. The stylized \ufb01nding is that training leads to improve-\nments in business practices, but no detectable effects on pro\ufb01tability\nor employment. As McKenzie and Woodruff (in press) discuss, the com-\nbination of sample size and sample heterogeneity leaves most of these\nstudies underpowered. Because we select more homogeneous samples\nof women and conduct four follow-up survey rounds, the study we re-\nport here has suf\ufb01cient power to detect comparatively modest changes\nin pro\ufb01ts and sales. Unlike the previous literature, we are also able to\nlook at the impact of training for potential owners, rather than only\nexisting businesses.2 The four survey rounds also enable us to measure\nthe trajectory of impacts, which turns out to be very important in prac-\ntice, especially for potential business owners.\n\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd little impact of training on the pro\ufb01tability of\nexisting businesses, even with a representative sample of subsistence\nenterprise owners and with more power than these other studies sug-\ngests that the lack of impacts in most of the existing literature may\nnot just be due to power issues, and that as a result business training\nprograms are less effective for existing enterprises than proponents of\nsuch training would suggest. However, our results also suggest some\npotential for impacts on new owners.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 de-\nscribes the sample and randomization procedure; Section 3 the content\nof the training and determinants of training take-up; Section 4 provides\nour main results; and Section 5 concludes.\n\n2. Context, the sample and randomization\n\nThe urban labor force participation rate for women aged 20 to 40 in\nSri Lanka was 43% in 2009, compared to rates over 90% for prime-aged\nmen (Department of Census and Statistics, 2010). Twenty-eight percent\nof women in paid work were self-employed, mostly in small and mar-\nginally pro\ufb01table enterprises. Given this context, our goal was to inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of business training to increase female labor\nforce participation rates and to raise the income levels of low-earning\nwomen already in business.\n\n2.1. Generating a sample\n\nWe chose to sample in the two largest urban areas in Sri Lanka \u2014\ngreater Colombo and greater Kandy.3 Within each of the two urban\nareas we selected 5 D.S. divisions in urban and semi-urban areas. We lo-\ncated a training venue in each of the ten D.S. Divisions, thus minimizing\n\n1 Examples include Field et al. (2010) in India, Karlan and Valdivia (2011) and Valdivia\n(2011) in Peru, Drexler et al. (in press) in the Dominican Republic, Calderon et al. (2012) in\nMexico, Berge et al. (2011) in Tanzania, Bruhn and Zia (2013) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\nand Gine and Mansuri (2011) in Pakistan; and are discussed in detail in McKenzie and\nWoodruff (in press).\n\n2 Short-term results in the new work by Martinez et al. (2013) in Chile also suggest pos-\n\nitive impacts for a combination of training and a grant on new business start-up.\n\n3 The project area includes seven of Sri Lanka's 25 districts: Colombo, Kalutara,\n\nGampaha, Kandy, Matale, Kegalle and Kurunegala.\n\nthe required travel time for project participants. Within each D.S. divi-\nsion we then conducted a door-to-door screening exercise in selected\nG.N. Divisions.4 The short screening survey gathered employment infor-\nmation on females aged 25 to 45 living in the household.\n\nFor self-employed women, our screening survey identi\ufb01ed women\nwho worked more than 20 h per week in self-employment, were in-\nvolved in a sector other than seasonal agriculture or \ufb01sheries, and had\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts of 5000 Rs or less (the median in the general population\nof female self-employed). We refer to this as our current business owner\nsample.\n\nThe second group of interest was women who were out of the labor\nforce, but who were likely to start working within the next year. The\nscreening survey asked each female between 25 and 45 years of age\nwhether she planned to enter self employment in the next year\nand, if so, the nature of the business that she planned to start. As a\nsignal of seriousness of intent, we sampled only women who were\nable to identify the type of business that they planned to start.\nSince the ability to participate in full-day business training program\nwas important for the proposed intervention, respondents were also\nasked about the availability of child care for any children younger\nthan \ufb01ve years of age. We refer to this as our potential business\nowner sample.\n\nBased on this screening exercise, we selected a sample of 628 current\nbusiness owners spread across 137 G.N.s and 628 potential business\nowners in 145 G.N.s. This sample was strati\ufb01ed to take approximately\n63 of each type in each D.S., in order to have equal sized groups at\neach training location. A baseline survey of these 1256 individuals was\nconducted in January 2009 (see timeline in Fig. 1.).\n\nTable 1 provides summary statistics on the two subsamples. The\ncurrent business owner sample consists of women in a wide range of\nindustries typical of female self-employment in Sri Lanka, such as tea\n(snack) shops, beauty shops, bag and mat manufacturing, tailoring\nand sewing, selling fruit and vegetables or groceries, making and selling\nlunch packets and string hoppers, baking cakes, and \ufb02ower shops. The\ntypical owner in our sample is 36, married, with ten years of schooling,\nand has been running the business for just over six years. Mean monthly\nbusiness income is around 4000 Rs (US$34, or around a dollar a day at\nmarket exchange rates), and constitutes about one-quarter of total\nhousehold income for the median and mean business owners. At base-\nline few enterprises were implementing the types of business practices\ntaught in the SIYB training program. Our business practices index\nmeasures the marketing, costing and record-keeping, stock control,\nand \ufb01nancial planning practices used in the \ufb01rm, with higher scores in-\ndicating better management practices (see Appendix 1). The mean \ufb01rm\nhas a baseline score of only 4.6 out of a possible 29. Only 17% of \ufb01rms\nkept written records, only 4% had done any advertising in the last six\nmonths, and only 3% had made a budget of what costs are likely to be\nover the next year. Fewer than 4% of owners had ever taken a training\ncourse which covered record-keeping, marketing, customer and suppli-\ner relations, or management of employees.\n\nAmong the potential business owners, 82% have worked before, but\nonly 24% have previously engaged in self-employment. Half of them\nclaim to have taken concrete steps towards opening a business in the\npast year. These women are about two years younger on average than\nthe current business owners, but are otherwise similar in many\nrespects. In particular, the potential and current business owners have\nsimilar levels of education, similar cognitive ability (as measured by\ndigitspan recall and raven tests), similar attitudes towards risk, and\nsimilar numbers of children on average. The household income of the\n\n4 The G.N. Division is the smallest of the four administrative levels in Sri Lanka: Prov-\ninces (9), Districts (25), Divisional Secretariat (D.S.) Divisions (324), and Grama Niladari\n(G.N.)

Randomization into treatment and control groups\n\nOur goal is to determine the impact of business training for these\nwomen, and to see whether this training has more effect when coupled\nwith a capital grant. We randomly selected 400 current owners and 400\npotential owners to be offered business training; half of these were pre-\nselected to receive a grant of 15,000 Rs (US$129) conditional on\n\ufb01nishing the training. At the time of offering the business training, indi-\nviduals were told only that half of those who completed the training\nwould be randomly chosen to receive a 15,000 Rs grant. Those who\ncompleted training and had been allocated to the training plus grant\ntreatment were then invited to a meeting at the training center where\nthey were given a check for the 15,000 Rs. The grant was framed as com-\npensation based on a random drawing for completing the program, and\nrecipients were told that the funds could be used for any purpose.\n\nFor the current owners, we dropped four enterprises with either\nmissing pro\ufb01ts or pro\ufb01ts above 10,000 Rs. Randomization to treatment\nwas then strati\ufb01ed by D.S. (10) and by whether or not there were chil-\ndren under age 18 without another person to look after them while the\nmother worked (54%). Within each stratum we formed triplets of \ufb01rms\non the basis of baseline pro\ufb01ts, and randomly allocated two out of three\n\ufb01rms in each triplet to receive training, and one of these two to get a\ngrant conditional on completing training, subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. being chosen to be offered training.5\n\nFor the potential business owners, in addition to D.S., we strati\ufb01ed\non whether or not they had taken any steps in the past year towards\nstarting a business (50% said they had), and whether they had ever\nworked before, even if only as an unpaid family worker (18% had not).\nWithin the 38 non-empty stratum we then randomly allocated one-\nthird to training only, one-third to training with a grant conditional on\ncompletion, and one-third to control, again subject to a quota of 40\n\ufb01rms per D.S. getting chosen to be offered training. Randomization\nwas done by the authors by computer, so any differences are due to\npure chance. Table 1 shows that randomization succeeded in generating\ngroups with similar observable characteristics.\n\n3. The training and take-up\n\n3.1. Training content\n\nWe use the International Labour Organization (ILO's) Start and\nImprove Your Business (SIYB) training program. SIYB is designed to\nmeet the needs of small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries,\nwith materials customized to local languages and context of each coun-\ntry. Started in Eastern Africa in 1977 (ILO, 2003), the program has now\n\n\u2022 Generate Your Business (GYB) is a three day training course designed\nto help potential entrepreneurs decide if they should start a business,\nto generate feasible business ideas, and to choose the best idea from\namong this set of choices.\n\n\u2022 Start Your Business (SYB) training works with potential entrepre-\nneurs who want to start their own business and already have a feasi-\nble business idea. The training is a \ufb01ve day course covering the main\naspects of starting a business, including selection of products and pric-\ning, organization of staff, purchasing of equipment and other inputs\nneeded to get started, and \ufb01nancial planning.\n\n\u2022 Improve Your Business (IYB) is a \ufb01ve day course which trains existing\nbusiness owners who want to develop their business. The modules\ncovered are marketing, buying, costing, stock control, record keeping,\nand \ufb01nancial planning.\n\nIn addition to these core modules, we added one day of training\nof a more technical nature. The purpose of this was to provide expo-\nsure to some relatively high-return sectors in which it is perceived to\nbe socially acceptable for women in Sri Lanka to work. These includ-\ned food manufacturing, beauty culture (hair dressing, beauty treat-\nments and bridal dressing), sewing clothes, plant nursery, and soap\nmanufacturing.\n\nWe contracted the Sri Lanka Business Development Centre (SLBDC),\na Sri Lankan non-pro\ufb01t training institution, to provide the business\ntraining. SLBDC introduced the SIYB program to the Sri Lankan market\nin 2001. All of the SLBDC training staff involved in the project were uni-\nversity quali\ufb01ed and trained under the national-level SIYB training pro-\ngrams conducted by the ILO. As such, they are all certi\ufb01ed by the SIYB\nAssociation of Sri Lanka as SIYB Trainers. Each had a minimum of \ufb01ve\nyears experience delivering SIYB training. Therefore, any failure to \ufb01nd\nimpacts should not be due to low quality trainers or inexperience with\nthe materials.\n\nThe potential owners were offered a package consisting of the\nfollowed by the technical training. The\nGYB and SYB courses,\nresulting course was nine days, with 7 h of instruction per day. The\ncurrent business owners were offered a package consisting of a\ncompacted refresher GYB course to help them think about new prod-\nucts they might offer or sectors they might work in, followed by the\nIYB course and technical training. Overall they received seven days\nof training, with 7 h of instruction per day. The training locations\nwere very central and easy to \ufb01nd within each D.S., and close to pub-\nlic transport routes.\n\nThe training cost us $126\u2013$131 per current business owner and\n$133\u2013$140 per potential business owner. The training was offered to\nparticipants for free, mimicking the approach used by many NGOs and\nmicro\ufb01nance institutions, who also often offer a transportation and\n\n5 This form of randomization is done to increase power (see Bruhn and McKenzie,\n\n6 See: http://www.ilo.org/empent/areas/start-and-improve-your-business/WCMS_159435/\n\n2009).

We included a 400 Rs\nper day attendance payment to cover basic transport cost (estimated at\n50 Rs per day) and the opportunity cost of attending. We explained\nthis in personalized visits to each individual in the treatment group,\nand also told them that half of those completing training would be\nrandomly chosen for a 15,000 Rs grant.7\n\n3.2. Take-up of training\n\nTraining took place in April and May 2009 and the cash grants\nwere dispersed in June 2009. There was very little drop-out among\nthose who began the courses, and take-up rates were similar\namong the potential and current groups. Overall, 282 of the 400 po-\ntential business owners (70.5%) offered training attended at least\none training session, and 261 (65.3%) received completion certi\ufb01-\ncates. Of 400 current business owners offered training, 279 (69.8%)\nattended at least one session and 268 (67.0%) received completion\ncerti\ufb01cates.8 Those who attended expressed satisfaction with the\ncourse in qualitative interviews and direct survey questions: 78%\n(81) of current (potential) business owners said they would strongly\nrecommend the course to others, and 86% said that the course was\nmore helpful than they had expected.\n\n7 As a result, our LATE estimates are the impact of training for those who would take it\nup when offered these incentives to attend. As noted, many organizations offer per diems/\ntransport costs. A number of government programs also offer the possibility of \ufb01nancing,\nincluding grants (e.g. Martinez et al. 2013).\n\n8 The working paper version of the paper examines the correlates of training take-up.\nAmong existing \ufb01rms, take-up is lower for those with higher opportunity costs of time\n(those earning higher pro\ufb01ts, working more hours, or in Colombo), higher for manufactur-\ning and retail \ufb01rms than services \ufb01rms, and not related to baseline business practices or\nelicited willingness to pay for such training. Among potential \ufb01rms, take-up is lowest in\nColombo, increases with age and the score on a Raven test of non-verbal ability, and is\nagain unrelated to expressed willingness to pay for training.\n\n3.3. Follow-up surveys\n\nFour rounds of follow-up surveys were conducted in September\n2009, January 2010, September 2010, and June 2011 \u2014 corresponding\nto 3\u20134 months, 7\u20138 months, 15\u201316 months, and 24\u201325 months after\nthe training. We refer to these as the round 2, 3, 4 and 5 surveys, respec-\ntively. The follow-up surveys asked detailed information about business\noutcomes, including the key performance measures of business pro\ufb01ts\nin the last month, sales in the last month, and capital stock (including\nraw materials and inventories). Business pro\ufb01ts were asked directly, fol-\nlowing the recommendations of de Mel et al. (2009b). Nominal values\nwere converted into real values using the Colombo consumer price\nindex. Appendix 3 addresses the possibility that training affected how\npro\ufb01ts were reported; we \ufb01nd that this is not driving any of our results.\nOverall attrition was low \u2014 of the 624 (628) current owners (poten-\ntial owners) selected for the experiment, 584 (588) were interviewed in\nthe second round, 591 (587) in the third round, 580 (560) in the fourth\nround, and 575 (556) in the \ufb01fth round surveys. We cannot reject equal-\nity of attrition rates across treatment groups by round 5 for the current\nenterprises (p = 0.25), but attrition rates are slightly lower for the\ntraining only group amongst the potential enterprises \u2014 a test of equal-\nity of attrition rates by round 5 has p-value of 0.085 for this group.\nAppendix 2 shows that the results from the sample of potential owners\nare robust to this attrition. In the case of refusals or inability to conduct\nan interview in the \ufb01fth round, proxy reports and direct observation\nwere also used to assess whether or not the owner was running a busi-\nness, with information on this outcome available for 97% of \ufb01rms.\n\nAs a \ufb01nal point of context, it is worth noting that on May 18, 2009,\ntowards the end of our training sessions, the Sri Lankan government\nformally declared the end of a 25-year civil war.

As such, our interventions took part in an environment in\nwhich the economy was growing and there may have been possibilities\nfor \ufb01rms to start-up and/or expand.\n\n4. What was the impact of the training and grants?\n\nWe want to estimate the impact of being assigned to training only, or\nto training plus a cash grant, on business outcome Yi,t for \ufb01rm i in follow-\nup time period t. We estimate the following model using the follow-up\nsurveys:\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00bc \u03b1 \u00fe \u03b3\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n1 assigned training onlyi\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;s\n\ni;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere Yi,0 is the baseline value of the outcome of interest, and \u03c0i,s is a\ndummy for being in randomization strata s.10 This Ancova speci\ufb01cation\nincludes the lagged outcome variable to increase power (McKenzie,\n2012) and is possible only for the current enterprises; the potential\nowners did not have baseline business outcomes to include in Eq. (1).\nWe estimate Eq. (1) round-by-round to determine how the treatment\neffects vary over time. In addition, we can estimate the average treat-\nment effect over all follow-up rounds by pooling together several\nrounds of follow-up surveys. We estimate the following regression:\n\n\u00bc\n\nY i;t\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n1 assigned trainingonlyi\n\n\u00fe \u03b3\n\n2 assigned training&cashi\n\nXq\n\n\u03b4\nt\nt\u00bc1\n\u00fe\u03b8Y i;0\n\n\u00fe \u03c0\n\n\u00fe \u03b5\n\ni;t\n\ni;s\n\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere q is the number of follow-up surveys, and the \u03b4t are survey round\ndummies. Standard errors are then clustered at the \ufb01rm level.\n\nEstimation of Eqs. (1) and (2) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT)\neffect, which is the effect of being assigned to receive training only, or\nbeing assigned to receive training and cash. Under the assumption\nthat the offer of training does not affect the outcomes of interest for\nthose who do not take up the training (which seems plausible for\n\n10 This speci\ufb01cation assumes that there are no spillovers (such as competing for the\nsame customers) among treated and control groups. 63% of current enterprises have no\nother \ufb01rms in the same sector receiving treatment in their G.N. Controlling for the number\nof \ufb01rms treated in the same sector within the G.N. does not affect our results, suggesting\nthat spillover effects are not driving our results.\n\nthose who attend no sessions), we can also estimate the treatment-\non-the-treated (TOT) effect \u2014 the effect of training for those who take\npart in at least one session. We estimate the TOT by instrumenting\nreceipt of some training with assignment to training only, and receipt\nof training plus cash with assignment to this treatment.\n\n4.1. Impact on the business practices of women who were already in\nbusiness\n\nIn Table 2 we examine whether the training led to any improve-\nments in business practices. The \ufb01rst three columns show that manage-\nment practices improved in both the short-term (3\u20134 months post\ntraining), and medium-term (15\u201316 months after training and 24\u2013\n25 months after training). The magnitude of the increase is similar at\nall follow-up intervals. In the last survey round, and for all rounds\ncombined, we can reject equality of the training and training plus cash\ntreatments at the 10% level, with the improvement in practices slightly\nhigher for those receiving the training plus grant treatment.\n\nThe magnitude of the increase is large relative to the low baseline\nlevels, with the TOT showing an increase of two to three total practices\nrelative to a baseline mean of \ufb01ve practices. However, given that the\nmaximum possible practices score is 29, the treated \ufb01rms are still clearly\na long way from implementing all the practices taught in the SIYB\ntraining. Columns \ufb01ve through eight pool together the different rounds\nand show that the training programs signi\ufb01cantly improved each sub-\ncomponent of the overall business practice score, with improvements\nin marketing, stock control, \ufb01nancial planning, and record-keeping.\n\n4.2. Impact on the business outcomes of existing business owners\n\nEighty-three percent of the current business owners remain in busi-\nness by the round 5 survey, and we cannot reject that survival is unrelated\nto treatment status (p = 0.37). Moreover, the treatments do not appear\nto affect which \ufb01rms survived: treatment status is unrelated to observable\ncharacteristics among surviving \ufb01rms. Given these \ufb01ndings, we proceed\nto analyze business outcomes for the group of surviving \ufb01rms.\n\nTable 3 examines whether the improvements in business practices\nfollowing the training, along with the cash grants, lead to improvements\nin business outcomes. We examine the impact of the two treatments on\nmonthly pro\ufb01ts (panel A), monthly sales (panel B), and capital stock\n\n\f204\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 3\nImpact on \ufb01rm performance for current enterprises.\n\nAll rounds pooled\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nLevels\n\n(1)\n\nTruncated\n\nLevels\n\n(2)\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nTruncated\n\nLogs\n\n(3)\n\nLevels\n\n(4)\n\nLevels\n\n(5)\n\nLevels\n\n(6)\n\nLevels\n\n(7)\n\nPanel A: Monthly pro\ufb01ts\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nTOT effects\n\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel B: Monthly sales\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel C: Capital stock\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\n\nPanel D: Hours worked in last week\nITT effects\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nBaseline mean:\np-Value for equality of treatment effects\nObservations\nFirms\n\n724.9\n(839.9)\n\u2212695.7\n(920.7)\n\n1079\n(1169)\n\u2212912.9\n(1152)\n4014\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1207\n\n(593.0)\n\u2212171.3\n(626.2)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1786\n\n(827.5)\n\u2212217.3\n(782.4)\n4014\n\n0.089\n\n0.035\n\n5171\n(4686)\n\u22122941\n(4422)\n12,659\n\n4436\n(3500)\n\u22121786\n(3512)\n12,659\n\n0.090\n\n0.102\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n17,221\n\n(7815)\n\u2212700.2\n(5616)\n31,272\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n10,379\n\n(3583)\n\u2212490.7\n(3338)\n31,272\n\n0.017\n\n0.003\n\n1.932\n(1.433)\n1.685\n(1.436)\n43.5\n\n0.866\n\n2097\n587\n\n1.751\n(1.382)\n1.889\n(1.399)\n43.4\n\n0.921\n\n2097\n587\n\n2019\n581\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.168\n(0.0716)\n0.0240\n(0.0752)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.248\n(0.100)\n0.0333\n(0.0949)\n8.14\n0.056\n\n0.143\n(0.0932)\n\u22120.0414\n(0.0967)\n9.09\n0.054\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.155\n(0.0691)\n\u22120.0671\n(0.0629)\n9.48\n0.001\n\n\u22120.0211\n(0.0320)\n\u22120.0130\n(0.0340)\n4.0\n0.799\n\n\u204e\n1758\n\n(932.6)\n11.75\n(889.5)\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n2526\n(1032)\n\n6.206\n\n(882.4)\n4004\n\n0.069\n\n\u204e\n6818\n(4020)\n\u22121718\n(3845)\n12,198\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n1910\n\n(898.5)\n\u221276.47\n(912.4)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n2819\n\n(1023)\n\n\u221286.50\n(924.0)\n4023\n\n0.041\n\n432.5\n\n(1123)\n\u2212460.3\n(1148)\n\n642.0\n\n(1233)\n\u2212605.9\n(1141)\n4016\n\n169.9\n\n(1099)\n\u2212760.6\n(1241)\n\n249.6\n\n(1220)\n\u22121042\n(1276)\n3994\n\n0.446\n\n0.437\n\n3284\n(5366)\n\u22121519\n(5386)\n12,520\n\n3079\n(6534)\n\u22123884\n(5993)\n12,600\n\n2129\n(6482)\n\u22122248\n(7177)\n12,548\n\n0.065\n\n0.411\n\n0.316\n\n0.514\n\n\u204e\n9535\n(4893)\n\u22123476\n(4192)\n30,137\n\n7270\n(4932)\n\u2212278.1\n(4596)\n30,359\n\n\u204e\n12,195\n(6379)\n\u22124452\n(5921)\n30,538\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n11,374\n\n(5760)\n3389\n(6474)\n30,350\n\n0.005\n\n0.113\n\n0.009\n\n0.257\n\n\u204e\n4.537\n(2.411)\n3.337\n(2.534)\n43.3\n\n0.621\n\n538\n538\n\n1.855\n(2.504)\n4.130\n(2.802)\n43.5\n\n0.414\n\n542\n542\n\n1.120\n(2.579)\n0.561\n(2.570)\n43.5\n\n0.826\n\n512\n512\n\n\u22121.717\n(2.701)\n\u22122.038\n(2.687)\n43.6\n\n0.904\n\n505\n505\n\nNotes: Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered at the \ufb01rm level when all rounds were used.\nAll speci\ufb01cations also include survey round dummies, baseline outcome value, and controls for randomization strata.\nTruncated levels truncate at the 99th percentile.\n\n\u204e p b 0.1.\n\u204e\u204e p b 0.05.\n\u204e\u204e\u204e p b 0.01.\n\n(including inventories and raw materials but excluding land and build-\nings, panel C). Panel D examines changes in hours worked in the busi-\nness by the owner. For each outcome we \ufb01rst show the results using\nall follow-up rounds pooled together to achieve greatest power, and\nthen examine the effects round-by-round. Pro\ufb01ts, sales and capital\nstock are all noisy variables, and so in addition to showing the impact\non the raw levels in column (1), we use two measures which are less\nsusceptible to outliers. The \ufb01rst, in column (2), involves truncating the\ndata at the 99th percentile of reported levels. The second, in column\n(3) takes the log of the outcome of interest. In panel A, we report both\nthe ITT and the TOT for pro\ufb01ts. For sales, capital stock, and hours we\njust report the ITT estimates. Approximate TOT estimates can be obtain-\ned by dividing the ITT by the proportion of \ufb01rms attending some train-\ning (0.70). Finally, Fig. 2A and B shows the cumulative distribution\nfunctions of pro\ufb01ts by treatment status for round 2 and round 5 respec-\ntively. These allow us to better assess in which parts of the distribution\neffects occur.\n\nThe results show that business training alone does not improve\npro\ufb01ts, sales, or capital stock of current \ufb01rm owners, or change the num-\nber of hours the owners spend working in their businesses. The CDF for\npro\ufb01ts of the training only group lies almost entirely on top of that of the\ncontrol group, and the point estimates of the impact on pro\ufb01t are actu-\nally negative in most survey rounds. These conclusions hold in each of\nthe follow-up rounds, suggesting that this is not a case of training taking\ntime to show impact.\n\nIn contrast, the combination of training and the cash grant does have\npositive and signi\ufb01cant impacts on capital stock, an effect which holds\nacross survey rounds. Truncated capital stock increases by an ITT of\n10,000 Rs, with the TOT for the pooled rounds of 15,357. Thus capital\nstock appears to have increased by the same amount as the grant for\nthose who completed the training and received the 15,000 Rs. There is\na signi\ufb01cant increase in pro\ufb01ts when using the pooled sample with\ntruncated or log pro\ufb01ts. This effect comes from the round 2 and 3\ndata. However, it appears that this increase in pro\ufb01ts is only temporary;\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n205\n\nA) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current\n Enterprises at First follow-up Survey \n\nconvergence to a steady state, but not dramatically changing the trajec-\ntory of the enterprise.12\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\ni\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nD\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nu\nm\nu\nC\n\nl\n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 2\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nB) CDF of Monthly Profits of Current \nEnterprises at Last follow-up Survey \n\n1\n\n8\n.\n\n6\n.\n\n4\n.\n\n2\n.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20000\n\n40000\n\n60000\n\n80000\n\nReal Monthly Profits in Round 5\n\nControl\nTraining only\n\nCash\n\nFig. 2.

The sales data are noisier than the pro\ufb01ts\ndata, and we generally see a positive, but not signi\ufb01cant, impact on\nsales. Hours worked are higher in the round 2 survey, but not signi\ufb01-\ncantly different from hours worked in the control group in subsequent\nrounds.\n\nThe combination of training and a grant therefore has immediate ef-\nfects which appear to dissipate a year later. Our prior research with a\ncomparable sample of existing female microenterprises in Sri Lanka\nfound zero average return to capital alone (de Mel et al., 2009a, 2012).\nThe combination of the \ufb01ndings that training alone has no effect, that\ngrants alone have no effect in the comparable sample, and that training\nand grants combined do have effects immediately after the grants are\nprovided suggests that there is a complementarity between training\nand grants in the short run. However, the fact that this effect appears\nto only be temporary suggests that the combination is speeding up\n\n11 However, a test of equality of the impact on truncated pro\ufb01ts over rounds 2 and 3 and\nthe impact over rounds 4 and 5 has p-value of 0.16 (p = 0.0998 for log pro\ufb01ts), so we can\nat best marginally reject no decline in pro\ufb01ts.\n\n4.3. Impact on starting a business among potential business owners\n\nWe now turn to the potential business owner group. Table 4 exam-\nines whether the treatments affect the likelihood that an individual en-\nters self-employment or engages in wage work. We see that 38% of the\ncontrol group operates a business at the time of the round 2 survey, in-\ncreasing to 56% by the round 4 survey and 57% by the round 5 survey.\nThis high rate of start-ups may re\ufb02ect both the screening of our sample,\nand the rapid growth of the economy during this period, improving the\nenvironment for starting a new business.\n\nThe combination of cash and training results in a 29 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of running a business in round 2, and a\n20 percentage point increase in the likelihood in round 3. But the gap\ncloses completely in rounds 4 and 5. This suggests that the treatment\nsped up entry markedly, but had no longer term effect. Those receiving\nthe cash and training treatment are 10 percentage points more likely to\nhave opened a business at any point since baseline, and 9 percentage\npoints more likely to have opened a business and then closed it \u2014\nwith these two effects netting out to give the near zero effect on busi-\nness ownership.\n\nTraining alone leads to a smaller, but still signi\ufb01cant, 12 percentage\npoint increase in the business ownership rate in round 2 for those\nattending training. The impact falls in magnitude and loses statistical\nsigni\ufb01cance in the subsequent survey rounds. The last columns of\nTable 4 show that the higher incidence of self-employment in rounds\n2 and 3 comes in part from a lower incidence of wage work for both\ntreatment groups. As with self-employment rates, however, by rounds\n4 and 5 there is no signi\ufb01cant difference in wage employment rates by\ntreatment status.\n\nThe treatments therefore seem to have sped up entry into business\nownership, but had no long-term impact on ownership rates. However,\nAppendix 4 shows that although the long-term rate of business owner-\nship is unchanged, the treatments change the selection of who operates\na business, with training alone leading to women who are, on average,\nless analytically skilled (as measured by a Raven test) operating busi-\nnesses, and the combination of training and a grant leading to less ana-\nlytically skilled and poorer women operating businesses.\n\n4.4. Impact on business outcomes for businesses started by potential owners\n\nThe treatments led to more business entry in the short-run. In the\nmedium-term, the effect of treatment on the entry rate disappears,\nbut treatment appears to affect the characteristics of entrants. This com-\nplicates the comparison of the business outcomes for treatment and\ncontrol groups, and so we employ different approaches to assessing\nimpacts.\n\nWe begin by looking at the impact of the treatments on total work\nincome from pro\ufb01ts (if a business owner) and wages (if a wage worker)\ncombined. We de\ufb01ne this income as zero for women who are not work-\ning. By this de\ufb01nition, income is not subject to issues of selection into\nemployment, and we can obtain experimental estimates as we did for\nthe current enterprise sample. We pool together rounds 2 and 3 to\ngive a short-term effect, and rounds 4 and 5 to give a medium-term\neffect. We pool rounds to enable us to display all the key results on\n\n12 We did not have a grant-only treatment in this project because of the prior work and a\ndesire to maximize power for the treatments involving training. Moreover, if we wanted\nto be able to compare the impact of training and cash to that of training alone in exactly\ncomparable groups, we would need to provide cash grants only to a subsample of women\nwho would have completed training if offered the training under terms comparable to the\ntraining treatment groups. Since ex ante it was not possible to tell who would complete\ntraining, this precluded the inclusion of a treatment group receiving only cash conditional\non being the sort of person who would complete training if offered it.\n\n \n \n\f206\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nTable 4\nImpacts on business ownership and wage work for potential owners.\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own a business Closed business Currently a wage worker\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nITT\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.201\n(0.0465)\n\u204e\n0.0904\n(0.0466)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.140\n(0.0483)\n0.0628\n(0.0490)\n\n0.0261\n0.0244\n(0.0485)\n(0.0501)\n0.0364 \u22120.0217\n(0.0488)\n(0.0499)\n\n0.0708\n(0.0436)\n0.0123\n(0.0446)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.290\n(0.0628)\n\u204e\u204e\n0.122\n(0.0606)\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n0.203\n(0.0658)\n0.0848\n(0.0638)\n\n0.0384\n0.0360\n(0.0689)\n(0.0704)\n0.0495 \u22120.0298\n(0.0643)\n(0.0652)\n\n\u204e\n0.104\n(0.0614)\n0.0161\n(0.0584)\n\nTOT\nReceived training & cash\n\nReceived training only\n\nFirms\np-Value for testing equality of\n\ntreatments\n\nControl group mean\n\n\u204e\n0.0634\n(0.0383)\n0.0166\n(0.0365)\n\n\u204e\n0.0935\n(0.0548)\n0.0219\n(0.0478)\n\n\u22120.0309 \u22120.0587\n(0.0281)\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0252 \u22120.0753\n(0.0275)\n(0.0286)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.00920 \u22120.000515\n(0.0317)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0210 \u22120.0180\n(0.0311)\n\n(0.0325)\n\n(0.0327)\n\n\u22120.0449 \u22120.0862\n(0.0392)\n(0.0394)\n\u22120.0338 \u22120.102\n(0.0370)\n\n(0.0357)\n\n\u204e\u204e \u22120.0138 \u22120.000779\n(0.0450)\n\u204e\u204e\u204e \u22120.0286 \u22120.0244\n(0.0406)\n\n(0.0465)\n\n(0.0428)\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\n588\n\n587\n\n547\n\n606\n\n0.020\n\n0.113\n\n0.842\n\n0.357\n\n0.173\n\n0.381\n\n0.477\n\n0.555\n\n0.573\n\n0.688\n\n0.244\n\n0.155\n\n0.830\n\n0.470\n\n0.714\n\n0.584\n\n0.096\n\n0.116\n\n0.116\n\n0.115\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

In\npart this re\ufb02ects the lower likelihood of wage employment. The point\nestimates are positive, but are equivalent to only about 7% of the control\ngroup's income. In contrast, the impacts are larger in the medium-term,\nwith increases in work income of 1494 Rs for the training only group\n(signi\ufb01cant at the 10% level), and 697 Rs (not signi\ufb01cant) for the train-\ning plus cash group. We also cannot reject the possibility that the two\ntreatments have effects which are equal in magnitude. The medium-\nrun point estimates re\ufb02ect increases in income of 14 to 30% relative to\nthe control group mean. The estimates suggest that the training-only\n\ntreatment costs of approximately 18,600 Rs per person would be repaid\nafter 12 months of the medium-term treatment effect, but the training\nplus cash cost would take 48 months of the medium-term treatment ef-\nfect to be repaid.\n\nThe remainder of panel A looks at the impact of the treatments on\nbusiness pro\ufb01ts, sales, capital stock, and business practices. These results\nare all conditional on running a business. We asked the potential busi-\nness owners about business practices only in rounds 4 and 5. We can\nnever reject equality of the two treatment effects, but the point estimates\non pro\ufb01ts and sales are higher for the training only treatments,13 the\n\n13 This difference is not statistically signi\ufb01cant, so it may just re\ufb02ect chance. Alternative-\nly, it might re\ufb02ect the fact that the training plus grant led to the new businesses being\nstarted by ex ante poorer individuals on average than is the case with the training only\ntreatment.\n\n\fS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\n207\n\nimpact on business practices is similar in magnitude for the two treat-\nments, and the point estimate of the effect on capital stock is larger for\nthe cash plus training treatment. The results for the training only\nintervention show signi\ufb01cant impacts on pro\ufb01ts and sales in the rounds\n4 and 5 surveys, with the magnitudes equivalent to a 43% increase in\npro\ufb01ts and a 40% increase in sales, both relative to the control mean.\n\nThere is no difference in the rates of business ownership by rounds 4\nand 5 of the survey, but both treatments led to women with lower\nRaven score starting businesses and the cash plus training treatment\nled to women with lower wealth starting businesses (see Appendix 4\nfor details). We would expect this selection to bias the OLS estimates\ndownwards, since lower ability and poorer individuals might be\nexpected to earn lower pro\ufb01ts. In this sense, the estimates in panel A\nmight be considered lower bounds for the treatment effect.\n\nHow sensitive are our results to this selection? To provide some\nindication, we use the sample of business owners to estimate a multino-\nmial logit for the probability of being in each of our three treatment\ngroups. We predict these probabilities as a function of wealth, ability,\nrisk attitudes, interest in attending training, interest in running a business,\nand personal characteristics \u2014 age, marital status and education. We use\nthe predicted probabilities to form a generalized propensity score\n(Imbens, 2000), and re-run our treatment regressions, reweighting by\nthe inverse of this generalized propensity score (GPS) and restricting\nthe sample so that the GPS has a common range across the three treat-\nments.14 Since the initial sample was randomized and the selection\nwas not extreme, trimming dissimilar observations removes only a few\nobservations.\n\nPanel B of Table 5 shows that the resulting estimates are reasonably\nsimilar to those in panel A, suggesting that the selection on observed\nability and wealth is not driving the estimates. We still \ufb01nd that the\ntraining-only intervention has a signi\ufb01cant impact on monthly pro\ufb01ts,\nthat both treatments have relatively large but insigni\ufb01cant impacts on\nsales, and that both treatments result in better business practices.\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nExisting business training experiments have typically found rather\nlimited impacts of business training on female micro\ufb01nance clients\nwho already own businesses. The stylized \ufb01nding is that women com-\npleting training undertake a few more of the business practices taught,\nbut the training does not have measurable impacts on business pro\ufb01t-\nability or employment levels. One response to this has been that these\nexisting studies have been unable to detect impacts because they\nwork with a selected subset of micro\ufb01nance clients and have low statis-\ntical power. We conduct an experiment on a sample of women which is\nboth broadly representative of low-income female microenterprise\nowners and more homogeneous than other studies. The homogeneity\nof the sample yields considerably more statistical power than other ex-\nperiments. We conclude that training alone is not enough to generate\ngrowth in subsistence businesses run by women. Adding capital leads\nto a boost in pro\ufb01tability in the \ufb01rst year following training, but the\neffect is temporary; these enterprises are no more pro\ufb01table than\nthe control group two years after training. These results highlight the\nchallenge in generating growth in subsistence-level female-owned\nmicroenterprises, and suggest that the binding constraints on growth\nmay lie outside the realm of capital and skills. One option is more inten-\nsive (and expensive) one-on-one personalized mentoring and consult-\ning, which Valdivia (2011) \ufb01nds to increase sales by 18% in female\nmicroenterprises in Peru. Another is addressing constraints to female\nparticipation in wage work, as these labor market failures are potential-\nly the reason that many women are operating businesses in the \ufb01rst\nplace (Emran et al., 2007).\n\n14 We look at the GPS distributions for each of the three treatment groups, and take the\nmaximum of the 1st percentile, and the minimum of the 99th percentile over these three\ngroups. We then trim observations which lie outside this range.\n\nIn contrast, our results are more encouraging with regard to the effect\nof business training for women who are out of the labor force. We \ufb01nd\nthat training helps these women to start enterprises more quickly, and\nto improve the management and pro\ufb01tability of the businesses they\nstart. The improvement in pro\ufb01tability comes in spite of the fact that\ntraining appears to induce more entry by women with lower measured\ncognitive skills, and more exit by women with higher cognitive skills.\nThe impact on business start-ups is consistent with results from recent\nrandomized experiments with micro\ufb01nance (Attanasio et al., 2011;\nBanerjee et al., 2011) which \ufb01nd that giving micro\ufb01nance to poor\nwomen with a high propensity for business ownership leads to some\nnew business start-ups, and with short-term results from Martinez et al.\n(2013). Taken together, these results suggest getting women to start sub-\nsistence businesses is easier than getting these businesses to grow.\n\nA \ufb01nal point is that our study highlights the importance of tracing\nout the trajectory of impacts and not just relying on a single follow-up\nsurvey. The impacts of business training vary over the time frame in\nwhich they are measured, particularly for potential enterprise owners.\n\nAppendix 1. Business practices score\n\nThe total score \u2013 the composite business practice score \u2013 ranges from\na minimum of \u22121 to a maximum of 29. The total is the sum of the fol-\nlowing component scores: the marketing score, the stock score, the re-\ncords score, and the \ufb01nancial planning score.\n\nThe marketing score ranges from 0 to 7, and it is calculated by adding\none point for each of the following that the business has done in the last\n3 months:\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what prices\n\nits competitors are charging\n\n\u2013 Visited at least one of its competitor's businesses to see what\n\nproducts its competitors have available for sale\n\n\u2013 Asked existing customers whether there are any other products\n\nthe customers would like the business to sell or produce\n\n\u2013 Talked with at least one former customer to \ufb01nd out why former\n\ncustomers have stopped buying from this business\n\n\u2013 Asked a supplier about which products are selling well in this\n\nbusiness' industry\n\n\u2013 Attracted customers with a special offer\n\u2013 Advertised in any form (last 6 months).\n\nThe stock score ranges from \u22121 to 2, and it is calculated by\n\nsubtracting one point.\n\n\u2013 If the business runs out of stock once a month or more.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\ndone in the last 3 months\n\n\u2013 Attempted to negotiate with a supplier for a lower price on raw\n\nmaterial\n\n\u2013 Compared the prices or quality offered by alternate suppliers\nor sources of raw materials to the business' current suppliers or\nsources of raw material.\n\nThe records score ranges from 0 to 8, and it is calculated by adding\n\none point for each of the following that the business does.\n\n\u2013 Keeps written business records\n\u2013 Records every purchase and sale made by the business\n\u2013 Able to use records to see how much cash the business has on hand\n\nat any point in time\n\n\u2013 Uses records regularly to know whether sales of a particular product\n\nare increasing or decreasing from one month to another\n\n\u2013 Works out the cost to the business of each main product it sells\n\u2013 Knows which goods you make the most pro\ufb01t per item selling\n\u2013 Has a written budget, which states how much is owed each month\nfor rent, electricity, equipment maintenance, transport, advertising,\n\n\f208\n\nS. de Mel et al. / Journal of Development Economics 106 (2014) 199\u2013210\n\nand other indirect costs to business\n\n\u2013 Has records documenting that there exists enough money each\nmonth after paying business expenses to repay a loan in the\nhypothetical situation that this business wants a bank loan\n\nThe \ufb01nancial planning score ranges from 0 to 12, and it is calculated\n\nby adding up to three points for each of the following two questions:\n\n\u2013 How frequently do you review the \ufb01nancial performance of your\n\nbusiness and analyze where there are areas for improvement\n\u2013 How frequently do you compare performance to your target\n\no Zero points for \u201cnever\u201d\no One point for \u201conce a year or less\u201d\no Two points for \u201ctwo or three times a year\u201d\no Three points for \u201cmonthly or more often\u201d.\n\nAnd adding one point for each of the following that the business has\n\n- A target set for sales over the next year\n- A budget of the likely costs your business will have to face over the\n\nnext year\n\n- An annual pro\ufb01t and loss statement\n- An annual statement of cash \ufb02ow\n- An annual balance sheet\n- An annual income/expenditure sheet\n\nAppendix 2. Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Bounding the start-up results among the\npotential sample\n\nAttrition rates in our study are low, but among potential business\nowners they are marginally lower for the training only group than\nthey are for the training plus grant and control groups. To assess the\nsensitivity of our results to this attrition, in Appendix Table 1 we provide\nconservative bounds for the impact of the treatments on business own-\nership. We create a lower bound for the treatment impact by assuming\nthat all control group individuals whose ownership status is unknown\nhad started businesses whereas all treated individuals with unknown\nstatus had not; an upper bound reverses this assumption. The bounds\nare reasonably narrow and the conclusion that there is a large treatment\neffect in the short-term which closes in the medium-term is robust to\nthis attrition.\n\nAppendix Table 1: Bounding the impact of business training on\nbusiness start-up. Dependent variable: Whether the individual owns a\nbusiness in a given survey round.\n\nAppendix 3. Are the results due to business training\nchanging measurement?\n\nA key challenge for evaluations of business training programs is the\npossibility that training causes owners to better understand the \ufb01nances\nof their \ufb01rm, leading to changes in how pro\ufb01ts and other \ufb01nancial\n\nAppendix Table 1\n\noutcomes are reported in surveys. We use two approaches to explore\nthe robustness of our results to this concern.\n\nThe \ufb01rst approach is to control directly for the record-keeping\npractice score in our treatment regression. Columns 1 and 2 of\nAppendix Table 2 show our treatment impacts on truncated pro\ufb01ts\nfor the combined round 4 and round 5 data without and with this\ncontrol, respectively. We do \ufb01nd that better record keeping is posi-\ntively and signi\ufb01cantly associated with higher pro\ufb01ts. This might\nre\ufb02ect causation in either direction \u2014 faster growing \ufb01rms may use\nmore record-keeping, or record-keeping may help \ufb01rms earn more\npro\ufb01ts or to report a larger share of pro\ufb01ts. However, controlling\nfor record keeping does not change our conclusions for the impacts\nof the treatments on pro\ufb01ts for the current or potential \ufb01rm groups.\nThis suggests that the failure to \ufb01nd an increase in pro\ufb01ts among the\ncurrent enterprises is not due to improvements in record keeping\nleading them to realize that pro\ufb01ts are lower than they thought. Sim-\nilarly, the \ufb01nding of a signi\ufb01cant positive effect for potential enterprise\nowners does not appear to be caused by better record-keeping making\nthem realize that pro\ufb01ts are higher than they thought.\n\nThe second approach is to check whether training affects the differ-\nence between self-reported pro\ufb01ts (elicited via a direct question), and\nbusiness revenue minus expenses. De Mel et al. (2009b) discuss several\nreasons why these two measures of pro\ufb01ts may differ, such as mis-\nmatches in the timing of input purchases and sales based on those pur-\nchases. Nevertheless, if the training causes individuals to keep better\ntrack of their \ufb01nances and start calculating pro\ufb01ts differently with great-\ner reference to revenue and expense records, we would expect training\nto reduce the absolute difference between these two measures. Column\n3 of Appendix Table 2 shows that this is not the case \u2014 training leads\nto an insigni\ufb01cant increase in the absolute difference between the\ntwo measures.\n\nTaken together, these two approaches suggest that our results are\n\nnot being driven by changes in reporting of pro\ufb01ts.\n\nAppendix Table 2: Are impacts being driven by better record-keeping?\n\nAppendix 4. Does business training change the selection of which\npotential owners operate businesses?\n\nTable 4 shows that by round 5, there was no signi\ufb01cant impact\nof either treatment on the overall rate of business ownership. In\nAppendix Table 3 we test whether training changed the skill and\nwealth composition of those operating businesses. We allow for het-\nerogeneity in treatment effects by two measures of skill \u2013 Raven\nscore and digitspan recall \u2013 and by our baseline household wealth\nindex. Panel A shows little in the way of selection according to ability\nas measured by the Raven test in the early survey rounds, but a sig-\nni\ufb01cant negative interaction by round 5 for both treatments \u2014 that\nis, training increases the self-employment rate of lower skilled indi-\nviduals relative to higher skilled individuals.\n\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nRound 2\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.157***\n(0.0455)\n0.0540\n(0.0461)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.244***\n(0.0456)\n0.119***\n(0.0457)\n\nRound 3\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n0.0953**\n(0.0469)\n0.0163\n(0.0480)\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.192***\n(0.0472)\n0.106**\n(0.0478)\n\nIndividuals\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\n628\n\nRound 4\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.0419\n(0.0477)\n\u22120.0408\n(0.0482)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.111**\n(0.0483)\n0.108**\n(0.0477)\n\n628\n\nRound 5\n\nLower\n\nBound\n\n\u22120.00521\n(0.0475)\n\u22120.0495\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nUpper\n\nBound\n\n0.0586\n(0.0478)\n0.00799\n(0.0481)\n\n628\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment.

Neither interaction between treatment\nand ability is statistically signi\ufb01cant when we look at the two treatment\neffects separately, but we do \ufb01nd an effect on business closure which is\nsigni\ufb01cant at the 10% level if we pool the two treatments (p = 0.085).\nThe results suggest that skilled women are no less likely to have ever\nstarted a business if they are trained, but are more likely to have closed\n\na business. The last two columns of appendix Table 3 show that higher\nability treated women are no more likely to be wage workers, but are\nmore likely to be out of the labor force. This is particularly true among\nthose eligible for both training and cash. Panel B of the table shows no\nsigni\ufb01cant heterogeneity with respect to our other measure of ability,\nthe digitspan recall. The correlation between Raven score and digitspan\nin this sample is only 0.18. The Raven score is a measure of analytical\nreasoning, whereas the digitspan recall is a measure more closely\n\nAppendix Table 3\n\nCurrently own a business\n\nEver own\n\nClosed business\n\nWage work\n\nNot working\n\nRound 2\n\nRound 3\n\nRound 4\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\nRound 5\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nPanel A: Interaction with Raven score\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nAssigned to cash \u2217 Raven score\n\nAssigned to training \u2217 Raven score\n\nPanel B: Interaction with digitspan recall\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nAssigned to cash \u2217 digitspan recall\n\nAssigned to training \u2217 digitspan recall\n\n0.232***\n(0.0840)\n0.0640\n(0.0835)\n\u22120.0111\n(0.0254)\n0.0105\n(0.0261)\n\n0.220\n(0.229)\n0.189\n(0.224)\n\u22120.00315\n(0.0371)\n\u22120.0167\n(0.0365)\n\nPanel C: Interaction with household wealth index\nAssigned to cash if \ufb01nish training\n\nAssigned to training only\n\nAssigned to cash \u2217 household wealth\n\nAssigned to training \u2217 household wealth\n\n0.198***\n(0.0468)\n0.0855*\n(0.0466)\n\u22120.0369\n(0.0293)\n\u22120.0515*\n(0.0302)\n\n0.149*\n(0.0892)\n0.0163\n(0.0857)\n\u22120.00344\n(0.0274)\n0.0188\n(0.0271)\n\n0.0472\n(0.234)\n0.244\n(0.240)\n0.0153\n(0.0379)\n\u22120.0304\n(0.0395)\n\n0.137***\n(0.0487)\n0.0652\n(0.0492)\n\u22120.0276\n(0.0295)\n0.00990\n(0.0309)\n\n0.0956\n(0.0916)\n0.0450\n(0.0894)\n\u22120.0246\n(0.0269)\n\u22120.00248\n(0.0267)\n\n\u22120.147\n(0.244)\n0.163\n(0.249)\n0.0283\n(0.0393)\n\u22120.0212\n(0.0408)\n\n0.0198\n(0.0500)\n0.0344\n(0.0500)\n\u22120.0594**\n(0.0289)\n\u22120.0290\n(0.0299)\n\n0.161*\n(0.0869)\n0.101\n(0.0860)\n\u22120.0492*\n(0.0253)\n\u22120.0451*\n(0.0255)\n\n\u22120.141\n(0.232)\n0.168\n(0.238)\n0.0273\n(0.0375)\n\u22120.0316\n(0.0390)\n\n0.0177\n(0.0484)\n\u22120.0226\n(0.0492)\n\u22120.0540*\n(0.0282)\n\u22120.0142\n(0.0298)\n\n0.0846\n(0.0769)\n0.0320\n(0.0799)\n\u22120.00500\n(0.0221)\n\u22120.00708\n(0.0241)\n\n\u22120.117\n(0.218)\n0.0560\n(0.222)\n0.0310\n(0.0353)\n\u22120.00728\n(0.0364)\n\n0.0696\n(0.0438)\n0.0121\n(0.0447)\n\u22120.0144\n(0.0254)\n\u22120.00663\n(0.0258)\n\n\u22120.0224\n(0.0711)\n\u22120.0503\n(0.0633)\n0.0308\n(0.0211)\n0.0246\n(0.0178)\n\n0.0699\n(0.185)\n\u22120.115\n(0.199)\n\u22120.00106\n(0.0297)\n0.0221\n(0.0327)\n\n0.0684*\n(0.0386)\n0.0174\n(0.0368)\n0.0356\n(0.0227)\n0.00817\n(0.0222)\n\nNumber of \ufb01rms\n\n607\n\n601\n\n582\n\n609\n\n620\n\n609\n\nNotes: Results shown are for OLS regressions of outcome on treatment assignment, and show ITT impacts.\nRobust standard errors in parentheses.\nAll speci\ufb01cations include randomization strata dummies and level effect of interacting variable.\n\n\u204e\np b 0.1,\n\np b 0.05,\n\np b 0.01.\n\n\u204e\u204e\u204e\n\n\u204e\u204e\n\n0.0406\n(0.0550)\n\u22120.0645\n(0.0550)\n\u22120.0147\n(0.0144)\n0.0180\n(0.0176)\n\n0.0640\n(0.147)\n\u22120.105\n(0.137)\n\u22120.0107\n(0.0234)\n0.0144\n(0.0222)\n\n\u22124.25e\u221206\n(0.0314)\n\u22120.0187\n(0.0305)\n0.0185\n(0.0184)\n0.00815\n(0.0179)\n\n606\n\n\u22120.195**\n(0.0822)\n\u22120.0187\n(0.0841)\n0.0586**\n(0.0242)\n0.0209\n(0.0240)\n\n0.0762\n(0.222)\n\u22120.0766\n(0.237)\n\u22120.0178\n(0.0360)\n0.0197\n(0.0389)\n\n\u22120.0249\n(0.0454)\n0.0423\n(0.0473)\n0.0385\n(0.0259)\n0.00904\n(0.0283)\n\n606"
